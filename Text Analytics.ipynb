      "ReutersChina's seven day repo rose to a record high of 10.77% in Shanghai, the highest since March 2003, according to Bloomberg*. Meanwhile, the one-day rate hit a record 12.85%. And Zerohedge reported that overnight repo hit 25%. The liquidity squeeze in China first began ahead of the Dragon Boat festival earlier this month. Spikes in interbank rates are common right before holidays.Â  But Diana Choyleva at Lombard Street Research said this is symptomatic of a bigger problem. She said capital flows had \"become a more important driver of domestic liquidity conditions in China's managed exchange rate system.\" In a new note to clients Bank of America's Ting Lu wrote: \"There are many factors behind the interbank liquidity squeeze that might be cited, but we believe that the ultimate reason is the central bankâs tough stance as the PBOC can practically provide unlimited liquidity to ease every squeeze if it wishes to.\"Â  Banks have been clamoring for a reserve requirement ratio cut. So why isn't the Chinese central bank stepping in? As we previously explained the People's Bank of China seems to be in no mood to support banks' constant demand for liquidity. \"It seems that the PBoC and some other regulators could be taking the opportunity of the tight funding conditions to âpunishâ some small banks which had previously taken advantage of the stable interbank rates to finance their purchase of higher-yield bonds,\" wrote Lu.Â  This also comes at a time when banks are required to meet their loan-to-deposit ratio requirement in filings to both the central bank and the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC). Earlier this week Fitch's Charlene Chu warned thatÂ  China's credit bubble is unlike anything in modern history. This also elicited some worrisome responses from some of our favorite China experts on Twitter. I hope you do realise that by now, China is on crisis watch. SHIBOR at 25% basically means there is no functioning interbank market in China - it's like money markets seizing up post-Lehman China faces \"Das Boot\" dilemma: Do you face the depth charges or dive deeper? Do you face defaults or pump even more money into bubble? Michael McDonough via Twitter Lu expects tight interbank liquidity conditions to last till July. * We updated the data to reflect the latest numbers quoted by Bloomberg\n",
      "YouTubeGoogle likely sees more data than any company on the planet. And that obsession carries through to hiring and management, where every decision and practice is endlessly studied and analyzed. In an interview with The New York Times' Adam Bryant, Google's Senior Vice President of People Operations Laszlo Bock explains that some of the biggest stalwarts of the hiring and recruiting world, the interview, GPA, and test scores, aren't nearly as important as people think.Â  Google doesn't even ask for GPA or test scores from candidates anymore, unless someone's a year or two out of school, because they don't correlate at all with success at the company. Even for new grads, the correlation is slight, the company has found. BockÂ has an excellent explanation about why those metrics don't mean much. \"Academic environments are artificial environments. People who succeed there are sort of finely trained, theyâre conditioned to succeed in that environment,\" he says.  While in school, people are trained to give specific answers, \"it's muchÂ more interesting to solve problems where there isnât an obvious answer,\" Bock says. \"You want people who like figuring out stuff where there is no obvious answer.\" As for interviews, many managers, recruiters, and HR staffers think they have a special ability to sniff out talent. They're wrong.Â  \"Years ago, we did a study to determine whether anyone atÂ GoogleÂ is particularly good at hiring,\" Bock says. \"We looked at tens of thousands of interviews, and everyone who had done the interviews and what they scored the candidate, and how that person ultimately performed in their job. We found zero relationship.\" Google also used to be famous for posing impossibly difficult and punishing brain teasersÂ during interviews. Things like \"If the probability of observing a car in 30 minutes on a highway is 0.95, what is the probability of observing a car in 10 minutes (assuming constant default probability)?\" Turns out those questions are\"aÂ complete waste of time,\" according to Bock. \"They donât predict anything. They serve primarily to make the interviewer feel smart.\" The only thing that works are behavioral interviews, Bock says, where there's a consistent set of questions that ask people what they did in specific situations. Many of the assumptions and practices we have about hiring came about because we didn't have anything better. For decades, theÂ only (relatively) consistent data point among hires was GPA and test scores. It was an easy way to sort, and because that's the way it was always done, people stuck with it.  We can do better now. And though Google has something of a head start and a lot more data, more and more companies are catching on.Â  The best thing about data? It's hard for people to contest. Even when people don't want to believe that they're underperforming, it's hard to dispute years worth of numbers. \"For most people, just knowing that information causes them to change their conduct,\" Â Bock says.\n",
      "Brutal day for the Australian dollar. First it dived after the Fed's hawkish press conference. Then just now it's falling after that bad Chinese Flash PMI. FinViz This is the perfect storm: Weakening demand for commodities from China, and a strengthening US dollar thanks to an improving US economy and monetary tightening.\n",
      "ReutersHSBC China Flash PMI fell to a nine-month low of 48.3 in June. This was below expectations for a marginal decline to 49.1, from 49.2 in May.  A reading below 50 indicates contraction. Chinese economic data for May disappointed markets, and analysts have been lowering their GDP forecasts.  âThe HSBC China Flash Manufacturing PMI dropped to a nine-month low of 48.3 in June, following on the sequential reduction in both production and demand,â wrote HSBC's Hongbin Qu in a press release. âManufacturing sectors are weighed down by deteriorating external demand, moderating domestic demand and rising destocking pressures. Beijing prefers to use reforms rather than stimulus to sustain growth. While reforms can boost long-term growth prospects, they will have a limited impact in the short term. As such we expect slightly weaker growth in 2Q.â An expansion in the inventory of finished goods, albeit at a slower rate, is also worrisome as China continues to cope with an excess capacity problem.  Here's a look at the trajectory of headline PMI: Markit Economics Here's a look at how the sub-indices performed: Markit Economics/HSBC China's official PMI report unexpectedly climbed to 50.8 in May. One of the key differences between the two reports are the survey size. The National Bureau of Statistics PMI survey looks at responses of 3,000 companies in 21 industries. This compares with about 430 companies surveyed by HSBC.\n",
      "The Nikkei was down as much as 1.3% to 13,073, after the Fed signaled on Wednesday that it could begin to taper its bond buying program this year. The FOMC upwardly revised its economic forecasts and in prepared remarks Fed chairman Ben Bernanke said the bond buying could be completely finished by 2014 if economic conditions continue to be supportive. The Nikkei has since pared some of its losses and is down 0.7%. A look at the five-day shows the early sell-off in the Nikkei after the Fed announcement: Yahoo Finance\n",
      "REUTERS/Jonanthan ErnstYields on U.S. Treasuries have soared since May 3 as bonds have sold off and investors have yanked money out of bond funds, driven by fears that the Federal Reserve would begin to signal tapering back of the bond purchases it makes under its quantitative easing program of monetary stimulus sooner rather than later. Today, the Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke had the opportunity to push back against the rise in rates and allay market volatility, which is exactly what the market consensus expected of him. Bernanke ended up doing the opposite â he essentially encouraged the rise in yields, saying it was for good reasons â and investors began dumping bonds, sending the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to 2.35% at the close, up 14 basis points from where it was before the release of the FOMC monetary policy statement and subsequent Bernanke presser this afternoon. The natural question, as UBS economists led by Maury Harris put it, is this:Â How much more bond market damage? Harris and his team actually think Fed tapering has already been priced into the market: The benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield already has risen from 1.66% at the start of May to 2.35% soon after the Fed's latest communications. As earlier mentioned, we have raised our 10-year Treasury note yield forecast for year-end 2013 by 30 basis points to 2.5% but are maintaining our 2.8% forecast for the end of 2014. Why not more damage than that to an already damaged bond market? Most importantly, we think that the bond market already has priced in tapering. Second, the Fed is reiterating that it will not even consider raising the Federal funds rate until unemployment is at a 6.5% threshold. Also, Bernanke's theory that bond yields will reflect how much securities the Fed holds (the \"stock\" theory) versus how much they buy (the \"flow\" theory) probably has at least some, albeit quite controversial, validity. If that's the case, maybe the bond market has already put the scariest part of the tapering story behind it.\n",
      "Bloomberg TelevisionBloomberg's Trish Regan and Bill GrossPIMCO's Bill Gross appeared on Bloomberg Television with Trish Regan and Adam Johnson to discuss the Fed's big FOMC announcement, economic forecasts, and press conference. Among other things, Gross emphasized the importance of the low inflation readings we've been getting out of the economy (emphasis added). I think the Chairman is almost deathly afraid and we have witnessed in speeches going back five or 10 years on the part of the chairman in terms of the helicopter speech and the reference not only to the depression but to the lost decades in Japan. I think he is deathly afraid of deflation. As we meander back and forth around the 1% level, I would suggest that the chairman to the extent that he perhaps has a limited time left in terms of being the Chairman, that he would guide the committee towards not only an unemployment rate which has been emphasized in terms of the Q&amp;A but also towards a higher inflation target, which is really a target. It's not something in terms of a cap, but the inflation target of 2% and for the next year or two, 2.5% has been specifically delineated in terms of that. It's a target. Those who think it is a cap and we are 1% below the cap and therefore the Fed doesn't care about it, I think the chairman told us the Fed does care about it and the closer we get to 2%, the better as far as he's concerned. In other words, this low inflation we're getting is not a good thing, and we should think of the Fed's 2.5% inflation threshold as a \"target,\" not a \"cap.\" Remember, half of the Fed's dual mandate is to keep price stable, not as low as possible. Here's a transcript of the Gross' interview via Bloomberg Television: Gross on today's statement by Bernanke: \"It was a pro-growth type of statement and a suggestion that some additional definitions in terms of when tapering might begin and when it might end. Obviously according to a 7% unemployment number that speaks in his mind and perhaps my mind to early 2014. But I might also say in terms of questions and answers, and that is critical I think, that he did speak to the conditional influence of inflation. That even if unemployment came down to 7% and inflation did not go up to 2%, they would look around and readjust their decision. This is a combined growth unemployment and inflation type of combination that has to be delicately managed and i think the market has misinterpreted the growth and the unemployment targets while leaving out the inflation targets going forward.\" On what he means by market misinterpretation: \"I think they are missing the influence on inflation that obviously the chairman has considered and perhaps the committee as well. There was a question and Q&amp;A that basically said, Mr. Chairman, if we are down at 1% inflation and it doesn't rise, then real interest rates are in a quandary to which you have limited flexibility, and he said, I agree completely with the premise of your question. I would think the markets are looking at the 7% unemployment rate and suggesting the tapering will end at that point. I would suggest that yes, he did say 7% in terms of an unemployment target where tapering would end, presumably in 2014, but he also qualified significantly a number of times that inflation has to go back up towards that 2% target and at the moment we are not there. Those who are selling treasuries in anticipation that the Fed will ease out of the market might be disappointed unless we have inflation close to 2%.\" On how the Fed will respond if we don't get to 2%: \"I think the Chairman is almost deathly afraid and we have witnessed in speeches going back five or 10 years on the part of the chairman in terms of the helicopter speech and the reference not only to the depression but to the lost decades in Japan. I think he is deathly afraid of deflation. As we meander back and forth around the 1% level, i would suggest that the chairman to the extent that he perhaps has a limited time left in terms of being the Chairman, that he would guide the committee towards not only an unemployment rate which has been emphasized in terms of the Q&amp;A but also towards a higher inflation target, which is really a target. It's not something in terms of a cap, but the inflation target of 2% and for the next year or two, 2.5% has been specifically delineated in terms of that. It's a target. Those who think it is a cap and we are 1% below the cap and therefore the Fed doesn't care about it, I think the chairman told us the Fed does care about it and the closer we get to 2%, the better as far as he's concerned.\" On Janet Yellen: \"I think she is a Siamese twin in terms of policy. She is very much a dove and has chaired the communication effort on the part of the Fed for the last few years which has emphasized and will continue to be emphasized. PIMCO does not want to be in a position of endorsing anyone. We would simply endorse a chairman or chairwoman who perhaps would emphasize Main Street as well as Wall Street which has been the emphasis for the past three or four years.\" On when he thinks the Fed will start to taper QE and when investors need to start trading on that: \"Based on what he said, based upon what the Fed estimates have given us in the last hour it suggests that yes, towards the end of the year, as we hit 7.25%, and if inflation rises as opposed to stays at 1% that the Fed would begin to taper and that ultimately they would end tapering in perhaps the first quarter of 2014. Is that a realistic possibility? At PIMCO, we don't think that really is. We think the chairman and the Fed are taking a very much of a cyclical type of view. He blames lower growth on fiscal austerity and expects towards the end of the year once that is gone, all of the sudden the economy will be growing at 3%. He blames housing prices moving up on homeowners that simply like higher home prices as opposed to emphasizing the mortgage rate, which is really what has provided the lift in the first place. To certain extent his driving analogy, which he talked about pulling back on the accelerator, I think he might be driving in a fog. I think the Fed itself may be driving in a fog. To think that is a cyclical as opposed to a structural problem in terms of our economy. I simply think and PIMCO thinks that real growth to lower unemployment below 7% is a long shot over the next 6, 12, 18 months.\"\n",
      "REUTERS/Fred ProuserMohamed El-Erian Virtually every segment of the fixed income, equity and commodity markets sold off viciously this afternoon on the back of the Fed statement and Chairman Ben Bernankeâs subsequent remarks. In the process, liquidity evaporated in certain places causing even more disorderly price moves. The immediate trigger for this afternoonâs market debacle was heightened concern that the Fed intends to reduce its support of the economy, undermining the marketsâ notion of the âcentral bank put.â And in reacting to signs that the Fed may gradually take its foot off the accelerator, markets completely brushed off repeated efforts by Chairman Bernanke to link ever more precisely the process of tapering to specific progress on the unemployment and inflation fronts. Given that this afternoonâs market reaction was basically a repeat of what occurred a few weeks ago in response to initial talk on Fed tapering, many will assume that the Fed took a calculated risk in refusing to walk back from earlier such talk. Such a Fed approach would makes sense if officials are highly confident of two factors and wish to act on a third consideration: Markets will now adjust to a new negative shock to the trio of the liquidity, risk and term premia. Heightened volatility will also fuel even greater risk aversion, including lower appetite for inventory buildup among brokers and greater cross-over investor migration back to home base. Expect further market volatility and liquidity dislocations in the immediate period ahead. The subsequent return of market stability would be influenced by the willingness of underexposed balance sheets to go long interest rate, credit and equity risk (which is likely to be limited in the very short-term) and/or calming words from the Fed (unlikely to materialize so soon after a combined FOMC statement and press conference, especially given mounting concerns about the Fedâs credibility and effectiveness). Most importantly, markets and the Fed are now even more highly dependent on sustained evidence that the real economy is indeed on a solid improving trends, including a consequential rise in actual and expected nominal GDP growth. With that, the focus will now shift firmly to the forthcoming June jobs report; and it will be even more intensive than usual.\n",

AllianceBernstein's Vadim Zlotnikov Gives Us The Argument For Active Management (Business Insider) After the financial crash there has been a loss of confidence in active management as passive investing strategies have outperformed. Vanguard's Jack Bogle has built his entire reputation on passive investing, or investing in stock market indices. Yet there is an argument to be made for active management, according to Vadim Zlotnikov, chief market strategist at AllianceBernstein \"Active management relies on the assessment of economic value in determining pricing of securities and assets. The last four years you have seen a significant divergence between the economic value of assets and its price in the market.Â  \"Active management is all about assuming that over long periods of time, pricing of securities and their values starts to converge. So the issue is not if it is going to work, it's when it's going to work. The time for it toÂ  work is when you have enough decline in the risk perception to at least believe that the future will exist and the future in some way, shape or form will be driven by historical rules. What has happened people have said is all these historical beliefs are no longer valid we're in a new world. \"If you start to have at least some comfort that historical economic rules are valid going forward, active management will deliver enormous returns. And you'll see that in some pick up in M&amp;A, some pick up in LBO, because those are the long horizon economic buyers. They're not buying paper, they're obeying an underlying business and those are the guys that are willing to place capital against that arbitrage.\" U.S. Target-Date Funds Saw 20% Growth In Assets Last Year (Reuters) Assets in target date funds grew 20% in 2012, according to data from BrightScope. Target date funds are funds that pool together money from different investors that plan to retire around the same time, and in which asset allocation tends to become more conservative as this date approaches.Â Â  Target date funds had over $503 billion at the end of 2012, according to Brightscope. Recently, companies like Goldman Sachs and Oppenheimer Funds have exited the market, according to Reuters.  Here's The Chart That Predicts Recessions 'Without Fail' (Gluskin Sheff) \"If there is one metric that has worked so well over time it is household assessments of the labour market â the consumer sector tends to get it right,\" wrote Gluskin Sheff's David Rosenberg.Â Â  \"Specifically, the University of Michigan survey component that measures consumer expectations on expected changes in unemployment rate.

Jeff Gundlach think U.S. Treasuries are set to rally.Â  \"No one's making any money anywhere, and I think that's because people think the conviction of central banks to continue the amount of monetary stimulus through bond purchases is less. And that's where we are right now. That's what's going to happen today again... \"I think, actually, rates are going to start falling. I think the place â the one place â that you're likely to make money in the next several weeks, maybe couple of months is actually, believe it or not, the most hated asset class on the planet: long-term U.S. government bonds. \"That's what I think is going to be the most successful investment, and what I'm really looking at to reach that conclusion is the fact that there is no inflation anywhere. There's no sign of inflation.\"\n",
      "Earlier this morning, CNBC personality and noted monetary hawk RickÂ Santelli told Wall Street Journal reporter Jon Hilsenrath he never predicated his arguments against Fed easing on inflation fears. Of course, the lack of accelerating inflation over the past few years is in part what's allowed the Fed to continue its bond buying program and keep interest rates low.Â  Here's the exchange: HILSENRATH: People have been saying for 3 or 4 years, 'Inflation inflation inflation!' Show me! Show me...Â  SANTELLI: NO no no no no, that's not the issue. The issue is, you're not going to have a lot of inflation showing up when you have no velocity. I've talked about commodity price volatility in the past, go back to the tapeâ¦I never said it was about inflation.Â  But the following \"Santelli Exchange\" segment from Oct. 2012 (via Zerohedge) certainly seems to suggest otherwise. In it he warns about how the seeds of Weimar were being sown by the Fed: \"To be nor not to be â of course I'm talking about inflation. But what's very interesting is, as I look up at gold â of course it's reversed off its highs â but today it hit a high of $1794.40. That's the highest intraday level for 2012, indeed it goes back to November last year when we traded over $1,800. But the issue is ,'To be nor not to be?' Is it inflation vacation or inflation gestation?â¦ Let's consider a couple of things. Printing money â is it really the answer? ... If we just print a million dollars for every man woman and child in the country, and handed it to them, won't that fix everything? Because in order to really look at printing â I like to take everything to the extreme... Look at the Weimar RepublicÂ and their hyperinflation in the early '20s. It didn't happen overnight, I've used the analogy, it's a lot like soybeans you plant em, you wait, conditions take some time, you need some sun you need some water, but ultimately things start to grow, and are we in that phase or not?\"   \n",
      "The release of the statement from the Federal Reserve's latest FOMC monetary policy meeting today and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's subsequent press conference sent bonds tumbling. The chart below shows the exact moments that triggered the sell-off in 10-year Treasury futures that caused bond yields to soar today. The initial leg down in bonds came right after the release of the FOMC statement and updated macroeconomic forecasts at 2 PM ET. The FOMC is more optimistic on the economy than before, which means tapering back of bond purchases under the central bank's program of monetary stimulus will probably come sooner than previously expected. The second, more notable, leg of the sell-off was triggered around 2:45 PM by Bernanke's response to a reporter's question about the sell-off in the Treasury market over the past several weeks that has sent bond yields soaring. Bernanke said, \"Yes, rates have come up some. That's in part due to more optimism  I think  about the economy. It's in part due to perceptions of the Federal Reserve. The forecasts that our participants submitted for this meeting, of course, were done in the last few days, so they were done with full knowledge of what happened to financial conditions. Rates have tightened some, but other factors have been more positive  increasing house prices, for example.\" Then, Bernanke concluded, \"If interest rates go up for the right reasons  that is, both optimism about the economy and an accurate assessment of monetary policy  that's a good thing. That's not a bad thing.\" In other words, please proceed. And the bond market did just that. Thinkorswim\n",
      "REUTERS/Jason ReedU.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke is pictured on a video camera display during a news conference following the Fed's two-day policy meeting at the Federal Reserve in Washington, June 19, 2013. Today, most were expecting Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke to attempt to soothe markets. After all, volatility in the Treasury market, caused by uncertainties surrounding how soon the Fed will begin to taper the pace of its bond-buying program, has had earthshaking reverberations around the world. (Volatility in the Japanese government bond market has increased dramatically, and emerging market stocks, bonds, and currencies have been getting crushed as Treasury yields have risen in the States.) Instead, Bernanke and the Fed did just the opposite. The FOMC revised up its economic forecasts â implying a quicker economic recovery, meaning tapering is closer than previously assumed â and even laid out a roadmap for tapering, saying bond buying could be completely finished by mid-2014. This development wasn't even borne out of the discussion in the Q&amp;A with reporters â Bernanke had it ready to go in his prepared remarks to launch the presser. Guns blazing. \"If the incoming data are broadly consistent with this forecast, the Committee currently anticipates that it would be appropriate to moderate the monthly pace of purchases later this year,\" said Bernanke, referring to the FOMC's newly-released macroeconomic projections. \"And if the subsequent data remain broadly aligned with our current expectations for the economy, we would continue to reduce the pace of purchases in measured steps through the first half of next year, ending purchases around mid-year.\" Bernanke went on to say that \"in this scenario, when asset purchases ultimately come to an end, the unemployment rate would likely be in the vicinity of 7%, with solid economic growth supporting further job gains.\" \"Bottom line - no backing down, no turning back, the Fed will taper unless the data deteriorate,\" said SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale strategist Kit Juckes following the presser. \"There is debate, but the fact the vol has not prompted second thoughts seems to me key.\" No second thoughts. Indeed, when pressed during the Q&amp;A about the recent surge in Treasury yields, Bernanke said, \"Yes, rates have come up some. That's in part due to more optimism â I think â about the economy. It's in part due to perceptions of the Federal Reserve. The forecasts that our participants submitted for this meeting, of course, were done in the last few days, so they were done with full knowledge of what happened to financial conditions.

That's not a bad thing.\" In other words, instead of leaning against the rise in yields that markets have seen over the past several weeks, Bernanke essentially green-lit the sell-off. The bond market did not take the tapering road map nor Bernanke's assessment of Treasury market volatility very well. Treasuries, which were already taking a hit following the release of the 2 PM statement and forecasts, really started selling off as Bernanke spoke. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note hit a high of 2.33% during the presser (versus levels around 2.21% before the 2 PM releases). For now, it appears that the FOMC is undeterred by recent volatility in the Treasury market, and that's something investors should keep in mind.\n",

      "REUTERS/Frank PolichThe Federal Reserve's June FOMC statement on monetary policy and updated macroeconomic forecasts are out. Stocks, bonds, and commodities are all selling off in the wake of the release. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke gave a press conference and Q&amp;A with reporters, and stocks and bonds kept selling off as he spoke. Bernanke said in his opening remarks that if the Fed's updated economic forecasts out today are correct, the FOMC may moderate purchases later in 2013 and end them around mid-2014 if the economic data warrants it. Bernanke said such a scenario envisions unemployment around 7%. The bond market is getting crushed on both the release of the statement and the Bernanke presser. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is now at 2.31%, up 10 basis points from prior to the 2 PM release. In the FOMC statement released at 2 PM, the Committee flagged \"further improvement\" in the labor market and asserted that downside risks to the economy have diminished since autumn. The Fed also says low inflation is partly reflecting transitory influences. Regarding economic forecasts, the Fed slightly lowered its forecast for 2013 GDP growth, but upgraded its projection for 2014 GDP growth. The Fed also updated its projections for unemployment. It now sees a lower unemployment rate in 2013, 2014, and 2015 than its previous forecast assumed. Projections were revised lower across the board for both core and headline inflation. Click here for the Fed's updated economic forecasts &gt; Below is the full text of the FOMC statement: Release Date: June 19, 2013 Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in May suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace. Labor market conditions have shown further improvement in recent months, on balance, but the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has strengthened further, but fiscal policy is restraining economic growth. Partly reflecting transitory influences, inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will proceed at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee sees the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished since the fall. The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months. The Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. The Committee is prepared to increase or reduce the pace of its purchases to maintain appropriate policy accommodation as the outlook for the labor market or inflation changes. In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will continue to take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases as well as the extent of progress toward its economic objectives. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; William C. Dudley, Vice Chairman; Elizabeth A. Duke; Charles L. Evans; Jerome H. Powell; Sarah Bloom Raskin; Eric S. Rosengren; Jeremy C. Stein; Daniel K. Tarullo; and Janet L. Yellen. Voting against the action was James Bullard, who believed that the Committee should signal more strongly its willingness to defend its inflation goal in light of recent low inflation readings, and Esther L. George, who was concerned that the continued high level of monetary accommodation increased the risks of future economic and financial imbalances and, over time, could cause an increase in long-term inflation expectations. The bond market has seen a sharp sell-off since May 3, when a better-than-expected jobs report convinced the market that the dreaded \"taper\" was closer than investors had previously thought. Bernanke exacerbated the volatility in the bond market on May 22 when, in a testimony before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, he failed to rebuff the suggestion that tapering could begin as soon as Labor Day (September 2), so long as incoming economic data reports justify such action.\n",
      "The Federal Reserve's FOMC statement and economic forecasts are out. One number jumped out at us.  For 2014, the Federal Reserve now estimates the unemployment rate will be in the range of 6.5% to 6.8%, down from an earlier forecast of 6.7% to 7.0%. This is noteworthy because in its December meeting, the Fed said it would use unemployment rate and inflation rate thresholds to help guide monetary policy. Those thresholds: 6.5% unemployment rate and 2.5% inflation rate. This suggests that the Fed may be warming up to tighter monetary policy sooner than later. Federal Reserve\n",

      "Saudi billionaire PrinceÂ AlwaleedÂ bin TalalÂ says he is looking at the world's largest cities, including Shanghai, Moscow, London, and New York, as possible locations to build a mile-high skyscraper that would be the world's tallest building by far. The prince is invitingÂ Dubai's biggest real estate developerÂ Emaar Properties, chaired by Mohammed Alabbar, to team up with his investment firm Kingdom Holding on the project. \"Right now we are discussing and evaluating the possibility of building a one-mile (1.6-kilometer) tower,\"AlwaleedÂ told Reuters by telephone late on Monday. \"We also need good partners. I invite Emaar and Mr. Alabbar to join forces with us and see how we can build the ultimate one-mile tower somewhere in the world.\" AlwaleedÂ did not say how the project would be financed if it went ahead, or when it might be completed. He said the cost had yet to be decided. But his ambition reflects the growing confidence of many Gulf companies as they expand overseas, aided by booming economies and rising asset prices in their home countries. \"I am now inviting the major cities of the world likeÂ Shanghai,Â Moscow,Â New York,Â LondonÂ and regional cities in theÂ Middle EastÂ to come and give their offers,\"Â AlwaleedÂ said. He said countries interested in hosting the world's tallest tower would have to offer attractive financing terms, tax breaks and other government support. Alabbar could not immediately be reached for comment. Over the past year, Emaar has committed itself to several other huge projects inÂ DubaiÂ and nearby countries. Industry experts have said building a one-mile skyscraper would involve technical and design challenges, such as how to supply water economically at that height, but would not be impossible. If it is built, the mile-high tower would surpass the world's current tallest skyscraper, the 828-meter (2,717-foot) Burj Khalifa inÂ Dubai, as well as the one-kilometer-highÂ Kingdom TowerÂ now being built by Kingdom Holding in the Saudi Arabian city ofÂ Jeddah. TheÂ Kingdom TowerÂ is expected to cost around 4.6 billion Saudi riyals ($1.2 billion) and will form part of a hotel, retail and luxury residential project. The structure is expected to reach ground level by the end of this year and to be completed in 2017, said Talal Al Maiman, executive director at Kingdom Holding. About 30 percent of useable land in the overall project, which will have an area of about 5.3 million square meters (57 million square feet), will be allocated to hotels. The remainder will be divided equally between retail and premium residential space, Al Maiman added. Kingdom Holding, which went public in 2007, has a market value of about $18.5 billion, making it one of the largest listed investment firms in theÂ Middle East.

It's the Wall Street buzzword for the gradual reduction of the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing (QE) plan: the monthly purchases of $40 billion worth of mortgage-backed securities and $45 billion worth of Treasury securities.  QE is intended to keep liquidity high and interest rates low in the credit markets. The prospect of a taper is arguably causing interest rates to rise. However, no one knows for sure when the taper will begin.  But they all have guesses. Laszlo Birinyi compiled Wall Street's predictions.  Here they are: Ticker Sense\n",
      "Mark Kolbe/Getty ImagesFor a while now Switzerland has been negotiating with the United States on measures that would give the Justice Department access to some details about American tax evaders with money in Swiss banks. Until now, that process was going pretty smoothly â it looked like the U.S. would strike a deal that would allow banks to bend some Swiss bank secrecy laws for American clients. That would mean the Justice Department wouldn't have to sue banks into oblivion for information. That's what killed old, venerated Swiss bank Wegelin &amp; Co. But Switzerland's Lower House of Parliament isn't having that at all. For the second time this week they struck down the deal with the U.S., according to Bloomberg â a deal the Upper House passed twice, and the executive branch was urging lawmakers to push through. One member of Parliament said the deal was essentially handing the U.S. a \"blank check for banks' misdeeds.\" Now there's fear that the U.S. will start a wave of indictments, picking banks off individually and hurting the Swiss economy. From Bloomberg: âOne can hope that the U.S. side understandsâ the parliamentary rejection, (Swiss Finance Minister Eveline) Widmer-Schlumpf said today. âTo hope, always is legitimate, also in politics. But one canât be too disappointed if all hopes arenât fulfilled.â Parliament had been asked by the government to approve the bill in an express procedure, allowing it to go into effect on July 1. The law wouldnât have affected at least 12 financial institutions, among them Credit Suisse Group AG and Julius BaerGroup Ltd., who are already under investigation in the U.S. The government has said that it will do whatever it can to comply with the U.S. by decree, but that its powers are limited there.

      "The Federal Open Market Committee will make its hugely anticipated announcementÂ about its next monetary moves at 2 pm today.Â  To mark the occasion, we figured we'd come up with a playlist to get you pumped. While there are many songs about monetary policy and Fed announcements, these are the best of the best. In each, we've explained the real meaning of the song. Check it out: Lots of people think this is about a guy meeting his drug dealer. That's totally wrong. It's about the market's reaction to the moment the Fed statement comes out. Bernanke (or whoever the Fed chief is at the time) comes out with the \"sweet taste\" of easing, and instantly the market has to react. Sample lyric: He's got the works/Gives you sweet taste/Â Ah then you gotta split/Because you got no time to waste Track:  On the surface, this is about the rapping prowess of one of the most important Wu Tang Clan members. But everyone really knows this is the song playing in Fed Chair's head as he announces another round of easing. Sample lyric: I'm on a mission that n***** say is impossible/But when I swing my swords they all choppable/I be the body dropper, the heartbeat stopper/Child educator, plus head amputator Track:  Most thought this song was taking aim at the narcissism of the '60s. It's actually about the Fed declaring its imperiousness to calls to raise rates even if the economy is improving. \"We're gonna stay there as long as we think we should\" is basically the Fed's manifesto about its independence. Lyric: We're gonna fire the exploding load in the milkmaid maiden head/We're gonna find the meaning/Of feeling good/And we're gonna stay there as long as we think we should Track:  We were never able to figure out what this song was about until recently. We now know it's an ode to FOMC members who perennially dissent from the main judgement (like Richmond Fed chief Jeffrey Lacker). Every meeting is a humiliating kick in the crotch. Lyric: And every single meeting with his so-called superior/Is a humiliating kick in the crotch/Many miles away/Something crawls to the surface/Of a dark Scottish loch Track:  This is not, as some might think, a song about a fraught relationship. It's actually about the fraught relationship between the New York Fed and primary dealers during debt auctions. Lyric: Hey! Wait! I got a new complaint/Forever in debt to your priceless advice/Hey! Wait! I got a new complaint/Forever in debt to your priceless advice Track:  This is not a tribute to early 20th century surrealists, but rather the rallying cry of hard metal traders as they watch the central bank expand the money supply, weakening the value of the currency. Â  Lyric: Wanna grow/Up to be/Â Be a debaser/DEBASER Track:  Some said this was a song about jealousy. It was actually a salute to Paul Volcker's successful attempt to beat back inflation jacking up rates.Â  Volcker famously was willing to tolerate an extraordinary amount of pain in the economy to accomplish his goals. Lyric: Monkey â too much at stake/Monkey â ground beneath me shake/Monkey â and the news is breaking/Shock! Shock!/Watch the monkey get hurt, monkey Track:  A song about sex? Not exactly. It can now be revealed that Britney is singing about nonperforming assets on member institutions' balance sheets. Lyric: With a taste of your lips Iâm on a ride/You're toxic I'm slipping under/With a taste of a poison paradise/Iâm addicted to you âÂ Donât you know that youâre toxic Track:  Finally, a song that explains everything: fighting the Fed is like fighting fate. You can't win. Lyric: Turn off your mind relax and float down stream/It is not dying, it is not dying/Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void/It is shining, it is shining. Track:Â  \n",
      "REUTERS/Brendan McDermidJeffrey GundlachSome of the big Wall Street shops are looking for the sell-off in the Treasury market to continue after the Federal Reserve's monetary policy statement and press conference today. Société Générale interest rate strategists, for example, suggest that Bernanke will actively help it along today. Jeff Gundlach, one of the biggest names in bond investing today, thinks we're in for just the opposite: he predicts U.S. Treasuries will begin to rally. In fact, he says long-dated Treasury notes are the only place investors will be able to make any money in the coming weeks and months. In an interview with CNBC, Gundlach said: When we were talking at my strategy team about a month ago, we were saying, \"What should we buy? What should we invest in?\" And I made the comment: \"I can't find anything that I think is going to be a money-maker.\" And when we look around the world, that's been the case. There's really nobody making any money in anything in the past month. Stocks are down  not much in the U.S.  but they're down hard in a lot of emerging markets and in Japan. Gold looks like it's going to break down to a new low. Bonds are going sideways. No one's making any money anywhere, and I think that's because people think the conviction of central banks to continue the amount of monetary stimulus through bond purchases is less. And that's where we are right now. That's what's going to happen today again... I think, actually, rates are going to start falling. I think the place  the one place  that you're likely to make money in the next several weeks, maybe couple of months is actually, believe it or not, the most hated asset class on the planet: long-term U.S. government bonds. That's what I think is going to be the most successful investment, and what I'm really looking at to reach that conclusion is the fact that there is no inflation anywhere. There's no sign of inflation. Gundlach believes this all comes together to form \"a bond market rally that is going to start fairly quickly.\"\n",
      "APFor decades, the SEC has let companies and individuals settle charges without actually admitting guilt, letting bigwigs more or less off the hook with only tacit âÂ but not legal âÂ acknowledgment of wrongdoing. No longer. The Commission will begin to push for more accountability on a \"case-by-case\" basis,Â the Wall Street Journal reports: From the Journal: The new policy, which came out of a review [SEC Chairman] Ms. White began when she joined the agency in the spring, will be applied in \"cases whereâ¦it's very important to have that public acknowledgment [of wrongdoing] and accountability,\" she told reporters at a Wall Street Journal CFO Network conference in Washington, D.C. Decisions will be made on a \"case-by-case\" basis, Ms. White said. But she added the agency intends to target cases of egregious intentional conduct or widespread harm to investors. Most cases still will be allowed to settle using the standard \"neither admit nor deny\" formula, Ms. White said. Washington legislators like Elizabeth Warren have recently urged the SEC to take big banks to task for wrongdoing, the Journal reports. Additionally, Judges like New York City's infamous Jed Rakoff have been railing against this policy for years. Here's what he said about it in his massive takedown of Citigroup back in 2011 and he blamed the SEC for the problem as well. \"Of course, the policy of accepting settlements without any admissions serves various narrow interests of the parties. In this case, for example, Citigroup was able, without admitting anything, to negotiate a settlement that (a) charges it only with negligence, (b) results in a very modest penalty,Â  (c) imposes the kind of injunctive relief that Citigroup (a recidivist) knew that the S.E.C. had not sought to enforce against any financial institution for at least the last 10 years... (d) imposes relatively inexpensive prophylactic measures for the next three years. In exchange, Citigroup not only settles what it states was a broad- ranging four-year investigation by the S.E.C. of Citigroup's mortgage-backed securities offerings... but also avoids any investors' relying in any respect on the S.E.C. Consent Judgment in seeking return of their losses. If the allegations of the Complaint are true, this is a very good deal for Citigroup; and, even if they are untrue, it is a mild and modest cost of doing business.\" Read the full report from the Wall Street Journal&gt;\n",

Bloomberg reports:  One of the implications of the fact that Ben is now very, very likely to be leaving at the beginning of the year is that hes going to want to get the so-called exit strategy under way, Feldstein said on CNBC television today. Hes going to want to start the tapering before he leaves so that he can say, I did all these good things, and I put us on an exit path.'\" Whether or not the Fed will begin its plans to taper back quantitative easing has been the source of pundit speculation and market volatility as of late.

The terse press release. \"The Board expects to discuss with Mr. Zimmer the extent, if any, and terms of his ongoing relationship with the Company,\" Men's Wearhouse said in the statement (see the full thing below). There is no polite mention of the founder's impact on the brand, as would be customary.  2. Shares and profits were gaining. The company just announced last week that profits were up a whopping 23%. Stocks have been consistently gaining over the past few years. This is not a company disaster scenario, a la Ron Johnson.  3. Men's Wearhouse cancelled its shareholder's meeting one day before. This sends a huge red flag to investors at a time when the company is trying its hardest to impress.

      "REUTERS/Jonathan ErnstFederal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke takes the stage for a news conference at the Federal Reserve offices in Washington, March 20, 2013.After a big sell-off in the bond market following the last time Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke made a public appearance (at his testimony before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress on May 22), most expect today's FOMC monetary policy statement to strike a dovish tone and attempt to pare back some of the volatility that has appeared in financial markets. The big concern, of course, is that the Federal Reserve will begin tapering back the pace of bond purchases it makes under its quantitative easing program of monetary stimulus sooner than the market was pricing in â maybe even as soon as September. SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale interest rate strategistsÂ Ciaran O'Hagan andÂ Vincent Chaigneau think the Fed has something very different in mind for today. In a note to clients, they write: We expect the Fed will choose to provide more helpful guidance on tapering and eventual exit steps. Our baseline scenario is that the Fed will begin tapering asset purchases in September. This guidance will likely come primarily during the press conference, though a slight nod to its initiation within a few meetings could appear in the FOMC statement. Volatility over the past few days â with substantial re-pricings on every recycled press article of Fed musings â seems to indicate that the market has not eased into a consensus ahead of the FOMC. If, as we expect, the Fed does provide additional guidance around tapering and does not remove the 'few meetings' construct established in Bernankeâs JEC testimony Q&amp;A â it could catch some market participants flat-footed. The bias for an FOMC response is towards a stronger sell-off â the stronger the guidance, the stronger the sell-off. That's markedly different from what most expect â perhaps some tweaking of the language in the FOMC statement and overtures from Bernanke during the presser to dissuade volatility. If O'Hagan and Chaigneau are right, markets may be in for a bit of a surprise today.\n",

Then, at 2:30, Bernanke will take the stage for a highly-anticipated press conference and Q&amp;A. Of course, the biggest thing everyone wants to know from the Fed today pertains to tapering back the pace of bond buying. Should investors really expect the Fed to begin tapering this year? If the language in the FOMC statement out at 2 strikes a dovish tone, markets will imply that the answer is \"no.\" Either way, though, the market will probably get the answer before Bernanke's press conference. And in the event that markets don't get their answer from the statement... \"None of the journalists attending todayâs FOMC press conference will want to waste a question on something as simple as when he might taper, because surely, someone else will do that for the benefit of everyone else in the room,\" says Miller Tabak Chief Economic Strategist Andrew Wilkinson.

      "That [sharply different levels of increased inequality] is significant because it means that new technologies and the ability of top talent to work on a global scale cannot explain the diverging fortunes of the top 1 percent and those below, since the Japanese have access to the same technologies and global markets as Americans. The answer must lie elsewhere. The authors point to government policy. As the paper shows, the income share of the top 1% in the U.S. declined from a high of around 24% just before the Great Depression to a low of about 9% in the late 1970s. Since then, it has soared all the way back to about 23% just before the Great Recession, but falling back to 20% in 2010. Other English-speaking countries have had similar \"U shaped\" patterns, as the authors describe them (i.e., reaching Great Depression levels again), but the share of the 1% is much less in other countries. For example, in Australia, even though the 1% share is close to what it was in the 1920s, it is still only 10% of total income, compared to 20% in the U.S. This difference is part of the reason thatÂ median wealthÂ is so much higher in Australia.The paper gives examples of other countries where the 1% share is permanently below its 1920s level, such as Germany, Japan, France, and Sweden. In all four cases, that share is only about 10%. As Johnston emphasizes, these countries are all essentially equal to the U.S. technologically (remember back in the 1980s when so many people thought Japan was poised to eclipse the U.S. in technology?), so their substantially lower levels of inequality stand in direct contradiction to frequent economists' claims that technology is the problem (Richard FreemanÂ has a balanced analysis).Â It is also important to point out, as Johnston does, that lower tax rates on the 1% have an impact on this. One suggestion the paper makes is that lower tax rates give CEOs and other top managers more incentive to bargain for higher income, so the effect even shows up in pre-tax income. Obviously, lower tax rates make post-tax income even more unequally distributed.\n",

He will, likely, take very great pains to differentiate between tapering and tightening.Â  He probably will take pains to defend the whole QE process (by laying out areas of progress from the very dire straits we were in). A very, very great deal will depend on how adept the reporters in the room are. Will they be able to pull out degrees of tapering?Â  Will it be in \"baby steps\" of reduction (5 billion or 10 billion)?Â  Will it be in both Treasuries and mortgages?Â  In equal amounts? What about the money that pours in from the existing portfolio (interest and maturity pay-down)?Â  Will that money be poured back into the markets (supplemental QE)?Â  Will they be forced to taper by diminished supply rather than monetary policy?Â  Will they announce that to the public? Finally, can they pin him down on exactly what targets/guidelines that the FOMC is using to adjust policy?Â  Just how hard are those targets? And that's just the antipasto.Â  It could be great if all rise to the occasion.\n",

      "BloombergBob JanjuahEveryone's waiting for the Fed's big announcement and press conference this afternoon.Â  And everyone is also guessing what the Fed might do next. The main thing no one can agree about is when the Fed will start tapering, or reducing, its bond-buying plan. And the best way to predict when the Fed will taper, one must understand why the Fed would taper. Nomura's bear Bob Janjuah believes the \"why\" is fear. From his note last week: So for me, âtaperingâ is going to happen. It will be gentle, it will be well telegraphed, and the key will be to avoid a major shock to the real economy. But the Fed is NOT going to taper because the economy is too strong or because we have sustained core (wage) inflation, or because we have full employment - none of these conditions will be seen for some years to come. Rather, I feel that the Fed is going to taper because it is getting very fearful that it is creating a number of significant and dangerous leverage driven speculative bubbles that could threaten the financial stability of the US. In central bank speak, the Fed has likely come to the point where it feels the costs now outweigh the benefits of more policy.\n",

      "Justin Sullivan/Getty Images/AFPUS satellite television provider Dish Network said on Tuesday it has dropped plans to submit a revised bid for Sprint Nextel, paving the way for a rival offer from Japan's SoftBank. Dish said it still saw \"strategic value\" in a merger with Sprint but that it would not submit a revised offer by Tuesday's deadline owing to Sprint's decision to terminate due diligence and accept a SoftBank offer. \"We will consider our options with respect to Sprint, and focus our efforts and resources on completing the Clearwire tender offer,\" it added, referring to a separate deal. The move clears the way for SoftBank's merger bid with Sprint targeting a 78% chunk of the third-largest US mobile carrier. At $21.6 billion, the deal could mark the biggest overseas acquisition ever by a Japanese firm. SoftBank had upped its offer last week by about $1.6 billion from an initial $20 billion offer. \"We look forward to receipt of the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) and shareholder approvals which will allow us to close in early July and begin the hard work of building the new Sprint into a meaningful third competitor in the US market,\" said SoftBank spokesman Kurano Mitsuhiro, after Dish pulled out of the bidding. SoftBank's Tokyo-listed shares closed 4.20% higher at 5,460 yen ($57) on Wednesday. Last week, a joint SoftBank-Sprint statement encouraged Sprint investors to vote for the deal at a June 25 shareholders meeting. In April, SoftBank chief Masayoshi Son painted his deal as superior, saying the Japanese firm had more experience in debt-financed takeovers and his bid could be consummated one year earlier than its rival. The proposed takeover would see already heavily indebted SoftBank taking on even more debt. But it won a high-profile boost as New York-based hedge fund Paulson &amp; Co, Sprint's second-largest shareholder, said it would back the SoftBank offer as it praised the company's \"exceptional operating expertise\". Under the revised deal SoftBank would offer Sprint shareholders $16.6 billion in cash, compared with $12.1 billion previously, reducing the amount of cash the firm would receive. Last month US national security officials approved SoftBank's planned takeover, but said any merger must see the appointment of an independent member to the Sprint board of directors to serve as security director. The director, who must be approved by US authorities, would oversee national security matters and serve as a point of contact for US agencies. The US Department of Justice in January urged regulators to delay the proposed cross-border takeover until the national security ramifications had been evaluated. Dish, which offered $25.5 billion for Sprint, had said the tie-up with SoftBank would pose national security risks. Separately, Dish and Sprint are seeking control over heavily indebted US broadband firm Clearwire's large array of wireless services. Sprint wants Clearwire's spectrum and broadband WiMax network, which is becoming more valuable with the surge of mobile Internet use. Dish is seeking Clearwire's spectrum as part of an effort to build a company that could deliver a fully integrated nationwide bundle of video, television, broadband Internet and voice services. Last week, Clearwire urged its shareholders to accept Dish's takeover offer of $4.40 per share in cash, which would give Clearwire a market value of $3.1 billion. Sprint's last offer was for $3.40 a share. Copyright (2013) AFP. All rights reserved. \n",
      "REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes rance's President Nicolas Sarkozy (L) shakes hands with International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Christine Lagarde after a meeting at the Elysee Palace in Paris October 8, 2011. Christine Lagarde, one of the most powerful women in the world as managing director of the International Monetary Fund, is facing acute embarrassment after a letter in which she urged former French President Nicolas Sarkozy to \"use me\" was found during a police raid on her Paris flat. An undated copy of the letter was found at Mrs Lagardes flat in Paris during a raid by police investigating a spiralling financial scandal surrounding payments to businessman Bernard Tapie. \"I'm on your side to serve you and serve your projects for France,\" she said in the letter. \"Use me during the time that suits you best and fits your action and your cast....If you decide to use me, I need you as guide and supporter: without guide, I might be ineffective, without support I might be implausible.\" She signed off: With my immense admiration, Christine L. She also claimed that she does not have \"personal political ambitions\" and remarked she does not want to become \"an ambitious servant\", referring to some members of Sarkozy's entourage. Critics described the letter as a pledge of allegiance and is reported to have been written during the 2007 French Presidential campaign, when she held a relatively minor post. The letter was leaked to French newspaper Le Monde, and its publication has caused acute embarrassment for the head of the IMF. Ms Lagarde was finance minister during Mr Sarkozy's term as President, before stepping down to become managing director of the Washington-based IMF in 2011. Her Paris flat was raided as part of an investigation into her handling of a 2008 compensation payment to a businessman supporter of ex-president Nicolas Sarkozy, her lawyer said. Police are investigating claims that Lagarde, when French Finance Minister under Sarkozy, acted illegally in approving the 285m arbitration payout to Bernard Tapie. Ms Lagarde denies any wrongdoing. Mr Tapie, a controversial business figure, went to prison for match-fixing during his time as president of French football club Olympique Marseille. Prosecutors working for the Court of Justice of the Republic suspect the arbitration was payback for supporting Mr Sarkozy in the 2007 presidential election. The massive payout enabled Mr Tapie to clear his huge debts and tax liabilities, and reportedly left him with up to 40m. Ms Lagarde has insisted the arbitration was vital to close a costly dispute, and has always denied having acted under orders from Sarkozy \n",
      "Federal Reserve / USStreamIn its America's Morning Comment note, Nomura has a really nice way of summing up Bernanke's challenge today, as the Fed releases a new policy statement, economic forecast, commentary (at the press conference). But in the tepid market open, there was no doubt that attention was firmly focused on the Fed today, where the conclusion of the two-day FOMC meeting offers market participants a new policy statement, summary of economic projections and a press conference from Chairman Bernanke to dissect and digest. While our US economists do not expect the FOMC to announce a change in its asset purchases this month, they believe all three will signal that the Fed is moving closer to a decision to reduce the pace of purchases, while at the same time seeking to minimize the significance of the move so to calm recent market jitters. That's it.

      "APSAO PAULO (AP)  Tens of thousands of Brazilians again flooded the streets of the country's biggest city to raise a collective cry against a longstanding lament  people are weighed down by high taxes and high prices but get low-quality public services and a system of government infected with corruption. That was the repeated message Tuesday night in Sao Paulo, where upward of 50,000 people massed in front of the city's main cathedral. While mostly peaceful, the demonstration followed the rhythm of protests that drew 240,000 people across Brazil the previous night, with small bands of radicals splitting off to fight with police and break into stores. Mass protests have been mushrooming across Brazil since demonstrations called last week by a group angry over the high cost of a woeful public transport system and a recent 10-cent hike in bus and subway fares in Sao Paulo, Rio and elsewhere. The local governments in at least four cities have now agreed to reverse those hikes, and city and federal politicians have shown signs that the Sao Paulo fare could also be rolled back. It's not clear that will calm the country, though, because the protests have released a seething litany of discontent from Brazilians over life's struggles. Yet, beyond complaints about the cost for bus and subway rides, protesters haven't produced a laundry list of concrete demands. Demonstrators mainly are expressing deep anger and discontentment  not just with the ruling government, but with the entire governing system. A common chant at the rallies has been \"No parties!\" \"What I hope comes from these protests is that the governing class comes to understand that we're the ones in charge, not them, and the politicians must learn to respect us,\" said Yasmine Gomes, a 22-year-old squeezed into the plaza in central Sao Paulo where Tuesday night's protest began. President Dilma Rousseff, a former leftist guerrilla who was imprisoned and tortured during Brazil's 1964-85 dictatorship, hailed the protests for raising questions and strengthening Brazil's democracy. \"Brazil today woke up stronger,\" she said in a statement. Yet Rousseff offered no actions that her government might take to address complaints, even though her administration is a prime target of demonstrators' frustrations. The protests have brought troubling questions about security in the country, which is playing host this week to soccer's Confederations Cup and will welcome Pope Francis in July for a visit to Rio de Janeiro and rural Sao Paulo. Brazil's media has scrambled to cover the sprawling protests  coverage that in some cases raised the ire of protesters, in particular that of the powerful Globo TV network. Whenever what appears to be a Globo helicopter swoops over a demonstration, protesters hiss, raise their fists and chant slogans against the network for what they say was its failure to widely show images of a violent police crackdown on protesters last week in Sao Paulo. Brazilian demonstrations in recent years generally had tended to attract small numbers of politicized participants, but the latest mobilizations have united huge crowds around a central complaint: The government provides woeful public services even as the economy is modernizing and growing. The Brazilian Tax Planning Institute think tank found that the country's tax burden in 2011 stood at 36 percent of gross domestic product, ranking it 12th among the 30 countries with the world's highest tax burdens. Yet public services such as schools are in sorry shape. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development found in a 2009 educational survey that literacy and math skills of Brazilian 15-year-olds ranked 53rd out of 65 countries, behind nations such as Bulgaria, Mexico, Turkey, Trinidad and Tobago, and Romania. Many protesting in Brazil's streets hail from the country's growing middle class, which government figures show has ballooned by some 40 million over the past decade amid a commodities-driven economic boom. They say they've lost patience with endemic problems such as government corruption and inefficiency. They're also slamming Brazil's government for spending billions of dollars to host next year's World Cup soccer tournament and the 2016 Olympics while leaving other needs unmet. A November report from the government raised to $13.3 billion the projected cost of stadiums, airport renovations and other projects for the World Cup. City, state and other local governments are spending more than $12 billion on projects for the Olympics in Rio. Nearly $500 million was spent to renovate Maracana stadium in Rio for the World Cup even though the venue already went through a significant face-lift before the 2007 Pan American Games. Attorney Agatha Rossi de Paula, who attended the latest protest in Sao Paulo along with her mother, called Brazil's fiscal priorities \"an embarrassment.\" \"We just want what we paid in taxes back, through health care, education and transportation,\" said the 34-year-old attorney. \"We want the police to protect us, to help the people on the streets who have ended up with no job and no money.\" Although a single group set the protests in motion with its demonstrations last week calling for lowered transit fares, the mass gatherings are showing no evidence of any central leadership, with people using social media to call for marches and rallies. Groups of Brazilians also staged small protests Tuesday in other countries, including Mexico, Portugal, Spain and Denmark. A cyber-attack knocked the government's official World Cup site offline Tuesday, and the Twitter feed for Brazil's Anonymous hackers group posted links to a host of other government websites whose content had been replaced by a screen calling on citizens to come out to the streets. Tuesday night's march in Sao Paulo started out peacefully but turned nasty outside City Hall when a small group lashed out at police and tried to invade the building. Different groups of protesters faced off, one chanting \"peace, peace\" while trying to form a human cordon to protect the building, the other trying to clamber up metal poles to get inside. At one point, one person tried to seize a metal barrier from another who was trying to use it to smash the building's windows and doors. The air was thick with police pepper spray and smoke after demonstrators set a TV satellite truck and a police lookout booth on fire. ___ Associated Press writers Jenny Barchfield in Rio de Janeiro, Marco Sibaja in Brasilia and Jill Langlois in Sao Paulo contributed to this report.

      "Flickr/garryknightLast week, the WSJ's ace Federal Reserve reporter Jon Hilsenrath wrote a piece on Fed strategy that got a lot of attention in markets. The gist was: Just because the Fed may signal a reduction in asset purchases doesn't mean that an interest rate hike is getting closer. Specifically Hilsenrath wrote: Federal Reserve officials have been trying to convince investors for weeks not to overreact when the central bank starts pulling back on its $85 billion-per-month bond-buying program. An adjustment in the program wont mean that it will end all at once, officials say, and even more importantly it wont mean that the Fed is anywhere near raising short-term interest rates. But in a note put out yesterday, Morgan Stanley Chief Economist Vincent Reinhart argues there's a flaw in this logic. Fed officials have been trying to convince everyone that their asset purchase decision  is data-dependent,  could be made soon, but,  once taken, does not put the balance sheet on a fixed course. The logical conclusion they hope everyone draws from this is that, as it is a flexible instrument subject to an ongoing calibration of the costs and benefits, the onset of tapering does not convey information about the date of the first fed funds rate hike.  Such an inference, however, is flawed. As long as the Fed is using the two instruments to influence the economy, policy decisions on their setting depend on the Feds outlook for the economy. A change in one reveals something about a change in the Feds outlook, which therefore has implications for the other policy instrument. Asset purchases can be a data-dependent, flexible instrument, but they will also be informative. Logically then, the Feds tapering talk reveals some combination of their being more confident about the economic outlook and less convinced that additional QE is providing net benefits. Basically, if both QE and rate decisions are data dependent, then you can't separate the two. Probably the best defense of the Fed on this is that for a rate hike, the parameters are incredibly clear. Evan's Rule sets the levels at which the Fed would consider raising rates, and it won't raise rates before then. On the other hand, the pace of QE is clearly more subjective (and possibly also takes into account a desire to prevent excess speculation). Anyway, between this confusion, and the latest comments from Obama hinting that Bernanke's time at the Fed is over, we should be in for one hell of a press conference today.\n",

      "Daniel Goodman / Business Insider.comIt's been an interesting couple of months in world markets. In a sense, we've seen a level of volatility and confusion that we haven't seen in awhile. This is especially apparent in any emerging markets (and of course Japan). And yet US equities have held up very well. And the rise in US interest rates is arguably a very bullish sign. In a note this morning, SocGen's Kit Juckes says the next leg of volatility is on its way. He suggests that in addition to rate volatility, that you should keep an eye on credit spreads, and that buying opportunities are likely to present themselves at some point in the future. The next leg of a summer of market volatility is likely to start in the days ahead. EM currencies are in the firing line first - BRL, INR and RUB all stand out. The next leg of the rise in US bond yields will probably take 10yr Note yields towards 2.5% this summer, and 2y/2y rates towards 2%. I'd pencil in CDX in the US at 100 from 82 currently and the iTraxx crossover at 500 in the fist instance, though the sell-off is a chance to buy credit after the summer. As for key asset allocation recommendations, LoadsaCash pretty much sums it up. In the meantime, all eyes remain on the Fed.\n",
      "REUTERS/Kevin LamarqueThe whole world has been anxiously waiting for this moment. The Federal Reserve will wrap up its 2-day Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting today. At 2:00 PM ET, it will publish its FOMC statement as well as an update to its economic forecasts. Then at 2:30 PM ET, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke will hold a press conference, which will include a Q&amp;A with economics reporters. Expectations Economists expect the Fed to announce no change in its benchmark interest rate target, which is currently at 0% to 0.25%.Â  Furthermore, they expect no change in its quantitative easing (QE) program, which consists of the Fed buying $85 billion worth of bonds each month to keep interest rates low. However, there is little agreement on when the Fed will begin to scale back its easy monetary policy. Recently, there has been tons of speculation that the Fed will soon taper, or gradually reduce, QE. This has been the source of volatility in the global financial markets as real interest rates have finally started to make a big up-move. \"There is no direct way to quantify what the market is pricing in for the size of the Fedâs remaining asset purchases,\" said Bank of America Merrill Lynch's David Woo. But he added that \"QE tends to push real yields lower but inflation breakevens higher (Chart 7).\" BAML, David Woo As such, everyone will listen very carefully for changes in language that may signal if and when tapering will begin.Â  In particular, the updated economic forecasts will scrutinized very carefully. Here'sÂ  the WSJ's Jon Hilsenrath: The evolution of these forecasts is a critical issue. Fed officials are unlikely at this meeting to change their $85-billion-per-month bond-buying programâlaunched to boost growth by pushing down long-term interest rates and pushing up asset prices, and spurring spending, hiring and investment. But what they say about the economy will send important signals about what they expect to do in the future. If they maintain confidence in their economic forecasts, it could signal they think they're on track to begin pulling back the program later this year.

      "ReutersChina's seven day repo rose to a record high of 10.77% in Shanghai, the highest since March 2003, according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, the one-day rate hit a record 12.85%. And Zerohedge reported that overnight repo hit 25%. The liquidity squeeze in China first began ahead of the Dragon Boat festival earlier this month. Spikes in interbank rates are common right before holidays. But Diana Choyleva at Lombard Street Research said this is symptomatic of a bigger problem. She said capital flows had \"become a more important driver of domestic liquidity conditions in China's managed exchange rate system.\" In a new note to clients Bank of America's Ting Lu wrote: \"There are many factors behind the interbank liquidity squeeze that might be cited, but we believe that the ultimate reason is the central banks tough stance as the PBOC can practically provide unlimited liquidity to ease every squeeze if it wishes to.\" Banks have been clamoring for a reserve requirement ratio cut. So why isn't the Chinese central bank stepping in? As we previously explained the People's Bank of China seems to be in no mood to support banks' constant demand for liquidity. \"It seems that the PBoC and some other regulators could be taking the opportunity of the tight funding conditions to punish some small banks which had previously taken advantage of the stable interbank rates to finance their purchase of higher-yield bonds,\" wrote Lu. This also comes at a time when banks are required to meet their loan-to-deposit ratio requirement in filings to both the central bank and the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC).

      "YouTubeGoogle likely sees more data than any company on the planet. And that obsession carries through to hiring and management, where every decision and practice is endlessly studied and analyzed. In an interview with The New York Times' Adam Bryant, Google's Senior Vice President of People Operations Laszlo Bock explains that some of the biggest stalwarts of the hiring and recruiting world, the interview, GPA, and test scores, aren't nearly as important as people think. Google doesn't even ask for GPA or test scores from candidates anymore, unless someone's a year or two out of school, because they don't correlate at all with success at the company. Even for new grads, the correlation is slight, the company has found. Bockhas an excellent explanation about why those metrics don't mean much. \"Academic environments are artificial environments. People who succeed there are sort of finely trained, theyre conditioned to succeed in that environment,\" he says.  While in school, people are trained to give specific answers, \"it's muchmore interesting to solve problems where there isnt an obvious answer,\" Bock says. \"You want people who like figuring out stuff where there is no obvious answer.\" As for interviews, many managers, recruiters, and HR staffers think they have a special ability to sniff out talent. They're wrong. \"Years ago, we did a study to determine whether anyone atGoogleis particularly good at hiring,\" Bock says. \"We looked at tens of thousands of interviews, and everyone who had done the interviews and what they scored the candidate, and how that person ultimately performed in their job. We found zero relationship.\" Google also used to be famous for posing impossibly difficult and punishing brain teasersduring interviews. Things like \"If the probability of observing a car in 30 minutes on a highway is 0.95, what is the probability of observing a car in 10 minutes (assuming constant default probability)?\" Turns out those questions are\"acomplete waste of time,\" according to Bock. \"They dont predict anything. They serve primarily to make the interviewer feel smart.\" The only thing that works are behavioral interviews, Bock says, where there's a consistent set of questions that ask people what they did in specific situations. Many of the assumptions and practices we have about hiring came about because we didn't have anything better. For decades, theonly (relatively) consistent data point among hires was GPA and test scores. It was an easy way to sort, and because that's the way it was always done, people stuck with it.  We can do better now. And though Google has something of a head start and a lot more data, more and more companies are catching on. The best thing about data? It's hard for people to contest. Even when people don't want to believe that they're underperforming, it's hard to dispute years worth of numbers. \"For most people, just knowing that information causes them to change their conduct,\" Bock says.\n",

      "REUTERS/Jonanthan ErnstYields on U.S. Treasuries have soared since May 3 as bonds have sold off and investors have yanked money out of bond funds, driven by fears that the Federal Reserve would begin to signal tapering back of the bond purchases it makes under its quantitative easing program of monetary stimulus sooner rather than later. Today, the Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke had the opportunity to push back against the rise in rates and allay market volatility, which is exactly what the market consensus expected of him. Bernanke ended up doing the opposite  he essentially encouraged the rise in yields, saying it was for good reasons  and investors began dumping bonds, sending the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to 2.35% at the close, up 14 basis points from where it was before the release of the FOMC monetary policy statement and subsequent Bernanke presser this afternoon. The natural question, as UBS economists led by Maury Harris put it, is this:How much more bond market damage? Harris and his team actually think Fed tapering has already been priced into the market: The benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield already has risen from 1.66% at the start of May to 2.35% soon after the Fed's latest communications. As earlier mentioned, we have raised our 10-year Treasury note yield forecast for year-end 2013 by 30 basis points to 2.5% but are maintaining our 2.8% forecast for the end of 2014. Why not more damage than that to an already damaged bond market? Most importantly, we think that the bond market already has priced in tapering. Second, the Fed is reiterating that it will not even consider raising the Federal funds rate until unemployment is at a 6.5% threshold. Also, Bernanke's theory that bond yields will reflect how much securities the Fed holds (the \"stock\" theory) versus how much they buy (the \"flow\" theory) probably has at least some, albeit quite controversial, validity. If that's the case, maybe the bond market has already put the scariest part of the tapering story behind it.\n",
      "Bloomberg TelevisionBloomberg's Trish Regan and Bill GrossPIMCO's Bill Gross appeared on Bloomberg Television with Trish Regan and Adam Johnson to discuss the Fed's big FOMC announcement, economic forecasts, and press conference. Among other things, Gross emphasized the importance of the low inflation readings we've been getting out of the economy (emphasis added). I think the Chairman is almost deathly afraid and we have witnessed in speeches going back five or 10 years on the part of the chairman in terms of the helicopter speech and the reference not only to the depression but to the lost decades in Japan. I think he is deathly afraid of deflation. As we meander back and forth around the 1% level, I would suggest that the chairman to the extent that he perhaps has a limited time left in terms of being the Chairman, that he would guide the committee towards not only an unemployment rate which has been emphasized in terms of the Q&amp;A but also towards a higher inflation target, which is really a target. It's not something in terms of a cap, but the inflation target of 2% and for the next year or two, 2.5% has been specifically delineated in terms of that. It's a target. Those who think it is a cap and we are 1% below the cap and therefore the Fed doesn't care about it, I think the chairman told us the Fed does care about it and the closer we get to 2%, the better as far as he's concerned. In other words, this low inflation we're getting is not a good thing, and we should think of the Fed's 2.5% inflation threshold as a \"target,\" not a \"cap.\" Remember, half of the Fed's dual mandate is to keep price stable, not as low as possible. Here's a transcript of the Gross' interview via Bloomberg Television: Gross on today's statement by Bernanke: \"It was a pro-growth type of statement and a suggestion that some additional definitions in terms of when tapering might begin and when it might end. Obviously according to a 7% unemployment number that speaks in his mind and perhaps my mind to early 2014. But I might also say in terms of questions and answers, and that is critical I think, that he did speak to the conditional influence of inflation. That even if unemployment came down to 7% and inflation did not go up to 2%, they would look around and readjust their decision. This is a combined growth unemployment and inflation type of combination that has to be delicately managed and i think the market has misinterpreted the growth and the unemployment targets while leaving out the inflation targets going forward.\" On what he means by market misinterpretation: \"I think they are missing the influence on inflation that obviously the chairman has considered and perhaps the committee as well. There was a question and Q&amp;A that basically said, Mr. Chairman, if we are down at 1% inflation and it doesn't rise, then real interest rates are in a quandary to which you have limited flexibility, and he said, I agree completely with the premise of your question. I would think the markets are looking at the 7% unemployment rate and suggesting the tapering will end at that point. I would suggest that yes, he did say 7% in terms of an unemployment target where tapering would end, presumably in 2014, but he also qualified significantly a number of times that inflation has to go back up towards that 2% target and at the moment we are not there. Those who are selling treasuries in anticipation that the Fed will ease out of the market might be disappointed unless we have inflation close to 2%.\" On how the Fed will respond if we don't get to 2%: \"I think the Chairman is almost deathly afraid and we have witnessed in speeches going back five or 10 years on the part of the chairman in terms of the helicopter speech and the reference not only to the depression but to the lost decades in Japan. I think he is deathly afraid of deflation. As we meander back and forth around the 1% level, i would suggest that the chairman to the extent that he perhaps has a limited time left in terms of being the Chairman, that he would guide the committee towards not only an unemployment rate which has been emphasized in terms of the Q&amp;A but also towards a higher inflation target, which is really a target. It's not something in terms of a cap, but the inflation target of 2% and for the next year or two, 2.5% has been specifically delineated in terms of that. It's a target. Those who think it is a cap and we are 1% below the cap and therefore the Fed doesn't care about it, I think the chairman told us the Fed does care about it and the closer we get to 2%, the better as far as he's concerned.\" On Janet Yellen: \"I think she is a Siamese twin in terms of policy. She is very much a dove and has chaired the communication effort on the part of the Fed for the last few years which has emphasized and will continue to be emphasized. PIMCO does not want to be in a position of endorsing anyone. We would simply endorse a chairman or chairwoman who perhaps would emphasize Main Street as well as Wall Street which has been the emphasis for the past three or four years.\" On when he thinks the Fed will start to taper QE and when investors need to start trading on that: \"Based on what he said, based upon what the Fed estimates have given us in the last hour it suggests that yes, towards the end of the year, as we hit 7.25%, and if inflation rises as opposed to stays at 1% that the Fed would begin to taper and that ultimately they would end tapering in perhaps the first quarter of 2014. Is that a realistic possibility? At PIMCO, we don't think that really is. We think the chairman and the Fed are taking a very much of a cyclical type of view. He blames lower growth on fiscal austerity and expects towards the end of the year once that is gone, all of the sudden the economy will be growing at 3%. He blames housing prices moving up on homeowners that simply like higher home prices as opposed to emphasizing the mortgage rate, which is really what has provided the lift in the first place. To certain extent his driving analogy, which he talked about pulling back on the accelerator, I think he might be driving in a fog. I think the Fed itself may be driving in a fog. To think that is a cyclical as opposed to a structural problem in terms of our economy. I simply think and PIMCO thinks that real growth to lower unemployment below 7% is a long shot over the next 6, 12, 18 months.\"\n",
      "REUTERS/Fred ProuserMohamed El-Erian Virtually every segment of the fixed income, equity and commodity markets sold off viciously this afternoon on the back of the Fed statement and Chairman Ben Bernankes subsequent remarks. In the process, liquidity evaporated in certain places causing even more disorderly price moves. The immediate trigger for this afternoons market debacle was heightened concern that the Fed intends to reduce its support of the economy, undermining the markets notion of the central bank put. And in reacting to signs that the Fed may gradually take its foot off the accelerator, markets completely brushed off repeated efforts by Chairman Bernanke to link ever more precisely the process of tapering to specific progress on the unemployment and inflation fronts. Given that this afternoons market reaction was basically a repeat of what occurred a few weeks ago in response to initial talk on Fed tapering, many will assume that the Fed took a calculated risk in refusing to walk back from earlier such talk. Such a Fed approach would makes sense if officials are highly confident of two factors and wish to act on a third consideration: Markets will now adjust to a new negative shock to the trio of the liquidity, risk and term premia. Heightened volatility will also fuel even greater risk aversion, including lower appetite for inventory buildup among brokers and greater cross-over investor migration back to home base. Expect further market volatility and liquidity dislocations in the immediate period ahead. The subsequent return of market stability would be influenced by the willingness of underexposed balance sheets to go long interest rate, credit and equity risk (which is likely to be limited in the very short-term) and/or calming words from the Fed (unlikely to materialize so soon after a combined FOMC statement and press conference, especially given mounting concerns about the Feds credibility and effectiveness). Most importantly, markets and the Fed are now even more highly dependent on sustained evidence that the real economy is indeed on a solid improving trends, including a consequential rise in actual and expected nominal GDP growth. With that, the focus will now shift firmly to the forthcoming June jobs report; and it will be even more intensive than usual.\n",

AllianceBernstein's Vadim Zlotnikov Gives Us The Argument For Active Management (Business Insider) After the financial crash there has been a loss of confidence in active management as passive investing strategies have outperformed. Vanguard's Jack Bogle has built his entire reputation on passive investing, or investing in stock market indices. Yet there is an argument to be made for active management, according to Vadim Zlotnikov, chief market strategist at AllianceBernstein \"Active management relies on the assessment of economic value in determining pricing of securities and assets. The last four years you have seen a significant divergence between the economic value of assets and its price in the market. \"Active management is all about assuming that over long periods of time, pricing of securities and their values starts to converge. So the issue is not if it is going to work, it's when it's going to work. The time for it to work is when you have enough decline in the risk perception to at least believe that the future will exist and the future in some way, shape or form will be driven by historical rules. What has happened people have said is all these historical beliefs are no longer valid we're in a new world. \"If you start to have at least some comfort that historical economic rules are valid going forward, active management will deliver enormous returns. And you'll see that in some pick up in M&amp;A, some pick up in LBO, because those are the long horizon economic buyers. They're not buying paper, they're obeying an underlying business and those are the guys that are willing to place capital against that arbitrage.\" U.S. Target-Date Funds Saw 20% Growth In Assets Last Year (Reuters) Assets in target date funds grew 20% in 2012, according to data from BrightScope. Target date funds are funds that pool together money from different investors that plan to retire around the same time, and in which asset allocation tends to become more conservative as this date approaches.

      "Earlier this morning, CNBC personality and noted monetary hawk RickSantelli told Wall Street Journal reporter Jon Hilsenrath he never predicated his arguments against Fed easing on inflation fears. Of course, the lack of accelerating inflation over the past few years is in part what's allowed the Fed to continue its bond buying program and keep interest rates low. Here's the exchange: HILSENRATH: People have been saying for 3 or 4 years, 'Inflation inflation inflation!' Show me! Show me... SANTELLI: NO no no no no, that's not the issue. The issue is, you're not going to have a lot of inflation showing up when you have no velocity. I've talked about commodity price volatility in the past, go back to the tapeI never said it was about inflation. But the following \"Santelli Exchange\" segment from Oct. 2012 (via Zerohedge) certainly seems to suggest otherwise. In it he warns about how the seeds of Weimar were being sown by the Fed: \"To be nor not to be  of course I'm talking about inflation. But what's very interesting is, as I look up at gold  of course it's reversed off its highs  but today it hit a high of $1794.40. That's the highest intraday level for 2012, indeed it goes back to November last year when we traded over $1,800. But the issue is ,'To be nor not to be?' Is it inflation vacation or inflation gestation? Let's consider a couple of things. Printing money  is it really the answer? ... If we just print a million dollars for every man woman and child in the country, and handed it to them, won't that fix everything? Because in order to really look at printing  I like to take everything to the extreme... Look at the Weimar Republicand their hyperinflation in the early '20s. It didn't happen overnight, I've used the analogy, it's a lot like soybeans you plant em, you wait, conditions take some time, you need some sun you need some water, but ultimately things start to grow, and are we in that phase or not?\"   \n",
      "The release of the statement from the Federal Reserve's latest FOMC monetary policy meeting today and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's subsequent press conference sent bonds tumbling. The chart below shows the exact moments that triggered the sell-off in 10-year Treasury futures that caused bond yields to soar today. The initial leg down in bonds came right after the release of the FOMC statement and updated macroeconomic forecasts at 2 PM ET. The FOMC is more optimistic on the economy than before, which means tapering back of bond purchases under the central bank's program of monetary stimulus will probably come sooner than previously expected. The second, more notable, leg of the sell-off was triggered around 2:45 PM by Bernanke's response to a reporter's question about the sell-off in the Treasury market over the past several weeks that has sent bond yields soaring. Bernanke said, \"Yes, rates have come up some. That's in part due to more optimism  I think  about the economy. It's in part due to perceptions of the Federal Reserve. The forecasts that our participants submitted for this meeting, of course, were done in the last few days, so they were done with full knowledge of what happened to financial conditions. Rates have tightened some, but other factors have been more positive  increasing house prices, for example.\" Then, Bernanke concluded, \"If interest rates go up for the right reasons  that is, both optimism about the economy and an accurate assessment of monetary policy  that's a good thing. That's not a bad thing.\" In other words, please proceed. And the bond market did just that. Thinkorswim\n",
      "REUTERS/Jason ReedU.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke is pictured on a video camera display during a news conference following the Fed's two-day policy meeting at the Federal Reserve in Washington, June 19, 2013. Today, most were expecting Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke to attempt to soothe markets. After all, volatility in the Treasury market, caused by uncertainties surrounding how soon the Fed will begin to taper the pace of its bond-buying program, has had earthshaking reverberations around the world. (Volatility in the Japanese government bond market has increased dramatically, and emerging market stocks, bonds, and currencies have been getting crushed as Treasury yields have risen in the States.) Instead, Bernanke and the Fed did just the opposite. The FOMC revised up its economic forecasts  implying a quicker economic recovery, meaning tapering is closer than previously assumed  and even laid out a roadmap for tapering, saying bond buying could be completely finished by mid-2014. This development wasn't even borne out of the discussion in the Q&amp;A with reporters  Bernanke had it ready to go in his prepared remarks to launch the presser. Guns blazing. \"If the incoming data are broadly consistent with this forecast, the Committee currently anticipates that it would be appropriate to moderate the monthly pace of purchases later this year,\" said Bernanke, referring to the FOMC's newly-released macroeconomic projections. \"And if the subsequent data remain broadly aligned with our current expectations for the economy, we would continue to reduce the pace of purchases in measured steps through the first half of next year, ending purchases around mid-year.\" Bernanke went on to say that \"in this scenario, when asset purchases ultimately come to an end, the unemployment rate would likely be in the vicinity of 7%, with solid economic growth supporting further job gains.\" \"Bottom line - no backing down, no turning back, the Fed will taper unless the data deteriorate,\" said Socit Gnrale strategist Kit Juckes following the presser. \"There is debate, but the fact the vol has not prompted second thoughts seems to me key.\" No second thoughts. Indeed, when pressed during the Q&amp;A about the recent surge in Treasury yields, Bernanke said, \"Yes, rates have come up some. That's in part due to more optimism  I think  about the economy. It's in part due to perceptions of the Federal Reserve. The forecasts that our participants submitted for this meeting, of course, were done in the last few days, so they were done with full knowledge of what happened to financial conditions.

That's not a bad thing.\" In other words, instead of leaning against the rise in yields that markets have seen over the past several weeks, Bernanke essentially green-lit the sell-off. The bond market did not take the tapering road map nor Bernanke's assessment of Treasury market volatility very well. Treasuries, which were already taking a hit following the release of the 2 PM statement and forecasts, really started selling off as Bernanke spoke. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note hit a high of 2.33% during the presser (versus levels around 2.21% before the 2 PM releases). For now, it appears that the FOMC is undeterred by recent volatility in the Treasury market, and that's something investors should keep in mind.\n",

      "REUTERS/Frank PolichThe Federal Reserve's June FOMC statement on monetary policy and updated macroeconomic forecasts are out. Stocks, bonds, and commodities are all selling off in the wake of the release. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke gave a press conference and Q&amp;A with reporters, and stocks and bonds kept selling off as he spoke. Bernanke said in his opening remarks that if the Fed's updated economic forecasts out today are correct, the FOMC may moderate purchases later in 2013 and end them around mid-2014 if the economic data warrants it. Bernanke said such a scenario envisions unemployment around 7%. The bond market is getting crushed on both the release of the statement and the Bernanke presser. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is now at 2.31%, up 10 basis points from prior to the 2 PM release. In the FOMC statement released at 2 PM, the Committee flagged \"further improvement\" in the labor market and asserted that downside risks to the economy have diminished since autumn. The Fed also says low inflation is partly reflecting transitory influences. Regarding economic forecasts, the Fed slightly lowered its forecast for 2013 GDP growth, but upgraded its projection for 2014 GDP growth. The Fed also updated its projections for unemployment. It now sees a lower unemployment rate in 2013, 2014, and 2015 than its previous forecast assumed. Projections were revised lower across the board for both core and headline inflation. Click here for the Fed's updated economic forecasts &gt; Below is the full text of the FOMC statement: Release Date: June 19, 2013 Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in May suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace. Labor market conditions have shown further improvement in recent months, on balance, but the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has strengthened further, but fiscal policy is restraining economic growth. Partly reflecting transitory influences, inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will proceed at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee sees the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished since the fall. The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months. The Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. The Committee is prepared to increase or reduce the pace of its purchases to maintain appropriate policy accommodation as the outlook for the labor market or inflation changes. In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will continue to take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases as well as the extent of progress toward its economic objectives. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; William C. Dudley, Vice Chairman; Elizabeth A. Duke; Charles L. Evans; Jerome H. Powell; Sarah Bloom Raskin; Eric S. Rosengren; Jeremy C. Stein; Daniel K. Tarullo; and Janet L. Yellen. Voting against the action was James Bullard, who believed that the Committee should signal more strongly its willingness to defend its inflation goal in light of recent low inflation readings, and Esther L. George, who was concerned that the continued high level of monetary accommodation increased the risks of future economic and financial imbalances and, over time, could cause an increase in long-term inflation expectations. The bond market has seen a sharp sell-off since May 3, when a better-than-expected jobs report convinced the market that the dreaded \"taper\" was closer than investors had previously thought.

For 2014, the Federal Reserve now estimates the unemployment rate will be in the range of 6.5% to 6.8%, down from an earlier forecast of 6.7% to 7.0%. This is noteworthy because in its December meeting, the Fed said it would use unemployment rate and inflation rate thresholds to help guide monetary policy. Those thresholds: 6.5% unemployment rate and 2.5% inflation rate. This suggests that the Fed may be warming up to tighter monetary policy sooner than later. Federal Reserve\n",

      "Saudi billionaire PrinceAlwaleedbin Talalsays he is looking at the world's largest cities, including Shanghai, Moscow, London, and New York, as possible locations to build a mile-high skyscraper that would be the world's tallest building by far. The prince is invitingDubai's biggest real estate developerEmaar Properties, chaired by Mohammed Alabbar, to team up with his investment firm Kingdom Holding on the project. \"Right now we are discussing and evaluating the possibility of building a one-mile (1.6-kilometer) tower,\"Alwaleedtold Reuters by telephone late on Monday. \"We also need good partners. I invite Emaar and Mr. Alabbar to join forces with us and see how we can build the ultimate one-mile tower somewhere in the world.\" Alwaleeddid not say how the project would be financed if it went ahead, or when it might be completed. He said the cost had yet to be decided. But his ambition reflects the growing confidence of many Gulf companies as they expand overseas, aided by booming economies and rising asset prices in their home countries. \"I am now inviting the major cities of the world likeShanghai,Moscow,New York,Londonand regional cities in theMiddle Eastto come and give their offers,\"Alwaleedsaid. He said countries interested in hosting the world's tallest tower would have to offer attractive financing terms, tax breaks and other government support. Alabbar could not immediately be reached for comment. Over the past year, Emaar has committed itself to several other huge projects inDubaiand nearby countries. Industry experts have said building a one-mile skyscraper would involve technical and design challenges, such as how to supply water economically at that height, but would not be impossible. If it is built, the mile-high tower would surpass the world's current tallest skyscraper, the 828-meter (2,717-foot) Burj Khalifa inDubai, as well as the one-kilometer-highKingdom Towernow being built by Kingdom Holding in the Saudi Arabian city ofJeddah. TheKingdom Toweris expected to cost around 4.6 billion Saudi riyals ($1.2 billion) and will form part of a hotel, retail and luxury residential project. The structure is expected to reach ground level by the end of this year and to be completed in 2017, said Talal Al Maiman, executive director at Kingdom Holding. About 30 percent of useable land in the overall project, which will have an area of about 5.3 million square meters (57 million square feet), will be allocated to hotels. The remainder will be divided equally between retail and premium residential space, Al Maiman added. Kingdom Holding, which went public in 2007, has a market value of about $18.5 billion, making it one of the largest listed investment firms in theMiddle East. Its assets include stakes in top Western firms such as Citigroup, News Corp andTwitteras well as luxury hotels around the world. (Editing by Andrew Torchia)\n",
      "Taper. Taper. Taper. Taper. It's the Wall Street buzzword for the gradual reduction of the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing (QE) plan: the monthly purchases of $40 billion worth of mortgage-backed securities and $45 billion worth of Treasury securities. QE is intended to keep liquidity high and interest rates low in the credit markets. The prospect of a taper is arguably causing interest rates to rise.

      "Mark Kolbe/Getty ImagesFor a while now Switzerland has been negotiating with the United States on measures that would give the Justice Department access to some details about American tax evaders with money in Swiss banks. Until now, that process was going pretty smoothly  it looked like the U.S. would strike a deal that would allow banks to bend some Swiss bank secrecy laws for American clients. That would mean the Justice Department wouldn't have to sue banks into oblivion for information. That's what killed old, venerated Swiss bank Wegelin &amp; Co. But Switzerland's Lower House of Parliament isn't having that at all. For the second time this week they struck down the deal with the U.S., according to Bloomberg  a deal the Upper House passed twice, and the executive branch was urging lawmakers to push through. One member of Parliament said the deal was essentially handing the U.S. a \"blank check for banks' misdeeds.\" Now there's fear that the U.S. will start a wave of indictments, picking banks off individually and hurting the Swiss economy. From Bloomberg: One can hope that the U.S. side understands the parliamentary rejection, (Swiss Finance Minister Eveline) Widmer-Schlumpf said today. To hope, always is legitimate, also in politics. But one cant be too disappointed if all hopes arent fulfilled. Parliament had been asked by the government to approve the bill in an express procedure, allowing it to go into effect on July 1. The law wouldnt have affected at least 12 financial institutions, among them Credit Suisse Group AG and Julius BaerGroup Ltd., who are already under investigation in the U.S. The government has said that it will do whatever it can to comply with the U.S. by decree, but that its powers are limited there.

      "The Federal Open Market Committee will make its hugely anticipated announcementabout its next monetary moves at 2 pm today. To mark the occasion, we figured we'd come up with a playlist to get you pumped. While there are many songs about monetary policy and Fed announcements, these are the best of the best. In each, we've explained the real meaning of the song. Check it out: Lots of people think this is about a guy meeting his drug dealer. That's totally wrong. It's about the market's reaction to the moment the Fed statement comes out. Bernanke (or whoever the Fed chief is at the time) comes out with the \"sweet taste\" of easing, and instantly the market has to react. Sample lyric: He's got the works/Gives you sweet taste/Ah then you gotta split/Because you got no time to waste Track:  On the surface, this is about the rapping prowess of one of the most important Wu Tang Clan members. But everyone really knows this is the song playing in Fed Chair's head as he announces another round of easing. Sample lyric: I'm on a mission that n say is impossible/But when I swing my swords they all choppable/I be the body dropper, the heartbeat stopper/Child educator, plus head amputator Track:  Most thought this song was taking aim at the narcissism of the '60s. It's actually about the Fed declaring its imperiousness to calls to raise rates even if the economy is improving. \"We're gonna stay there as long as we think we should\" is basically the Fed's manifesto about its independence. Lyric: We're gonna fire the exploding load in the milkmaid maiden head/We're gonna find the meaning/Of feeling good/And we're gonna stay there as long as we think we should Track:  We were never able to figure out what this song was about until recently. We now know it's an ode to FOMC members who perennially dissent from the main judgement (like Richmond Fed chief Jeffrey Lacker). Every meeting is a humiliating kick in the crotch. Lyric: And every single meeting with his so-called superior/Is a humiliating kick in the crotch/Many miles away/Something crawls to the surface/Of a dark Scottish loch Track:  This is not, as some might think, a song about a fraught relationship. It's actually about the fraught relationship between the New York Fed and primary dealers during debt auctions. Lyric: Hey! Wait! I got a new complaint/Forever in debt to your priceless advice/Hey! Wait! I got a new complaint/Forever in debt to your priceless advice Track:  This is not a tribute to early 20th century surrealists, but rather the rallying cry of hard metal traders as they watch the central bank expand the money supply, weakening the value of the currency.  Lyric: Wanna grow/Up to be/Be a debaser/DEBASER Track:  Some said this was a song about jealousy. It was actually a salute to Paul Volcker's successful attempt to beat back inflation jacking up rates. Volcker famously was willing to tolerate an extraordinary amount of pain in the economy to accomplish his goals. Lyric: Monkey  too much at stake/Monkey  ground beneath me shake/Monkey  and the news is breaking/Shock! Shock!/Watch the monkey get hurt, monkey Track:  A song about sex? Not exactly. It can now be revealed that Britney is singing about nonperforming assets on member institutions' balance sheets. Lyric: With a taste of your lips Im on a ride/You're toxic I'm slipping under/With a taste of a poison paradise/Im addicted to you Dont you know that youre toxic Track:  Finally, a song that explains everything: fighting the Fed is like fighting fate. You can't win. Lyric: Turn off your mind relax and float down stream/It is not dying, it is not dying/Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void/It is shining, it is shining. Track: \n",
      "REUTERS/Brendan McDermidJeffrey GundlachSome of the big Wall Street shops are looking for the sell-off in the Treasury market to continue after the Federal Reserve's monetary policy statement and press conference today. Socit Gnrale interest rate strategists, for example, suggest that Bernanke will actively help it along today. Jeff Gundlach, one of the biggest names in bond investing today, thinks we're in for just the opposite: he predicts U.S. Treasuries will begin to rally. In fact, he says long-dated Treasury notes are the only place investors will be able to make any money in the coming weeks and months. In an interview with CNBC, Gundlach said: When we were talking at my strategy team about a month ago, we were saying, \"What should we buy? What should we invest in?\" And I made the comment: \"I can't find anything that I think is going to be a money-maker.\" And when we look around the world, that's been the case. There's really nobody making any money in anything in the past month. Stocks are down not much in the U.S. but they're down hard in a lot of emerging markets and in Japan.Gold looks like it's going to break down to a new low. Bonds are going sideways. No one's making any money anywhere, and I think that's because people think the conviction of central banks to continue the amount of monetary stimulus through bond purchases is less. And that's where we are right now. That's what's going to happen today again... I think, actually, rates are going to start falling. I think the place the one place that you're likely to make money in the next several weeks, maybe couple of months is actually, believe it or not, the most hated asset class on the planet: long-term U.S. government bonds. That's what I think is going to be the most successful investment, and what I'm really looking at to reach that conclusion is the fact that there is no inflation anywhere. There's no sign of inflation. Gundlach believes this all comes together to form \"a bond market rally that is going to start fairly quickly.\"\n",
      "APFor decades, the SEC has let companies and individuals settle charges without actually admitting guilt, letting bigwigs more or less off the hook with only tacit but not legal acknowledgment of wrongdoing. No longer. The Commission will begin to push for more accountability on a \"case-by-case\" basis,the Wall Street Journal reports: From the Journal: The new policy, which came out of a review [SEC Chairman] Ms. White began when she joined the agency in the spring, will be applied in \"cases whereit's very important to have that public acknowledgment [of wrongdoing] and accountability,\" she told reporters at a Wall Street Journal CFO Network conference in Washington, D.C. Decisions will be made on a \"case-by-case\" basis, Ms. White said. But she added the agency intends to target cases of egregious intentional conduct or widespread harm to investors. Most cases still will be allowed to settle using the standard \"neither admit nor deny\" formula, Ms. White said. Washington legislators like Elizabeth Warren have recently urged the SEC to take big banks to task for wrongdoing, the Journal reports. Additionally, Judges like New York City's infamous Jed Rakoff have been railing against this policy for years. Here's what he said about it in his massive takedown of Citigroup back in 2011 and he blamed the SEC for the problem as well. \"Of course, the policy of accepting settlements without any admissions serves various narrow interests of the parties. In this case, for example, Citigroup was able, without admitting anything, to negotiate a settlement that (a) charges it only with negligence, (b) results in a very modest penalty, (c) imposes the kind of injunctive relief that Citigroup (a recidivist) knew that the S.E.C. had not sought to enforce against any financial institution for at least the last 10 years... (d) imposes relatively inexpensive prophylactic measures for the next three years. In exchange, Citigroup not only settles what it states was a broad- ranging four-year investigation by the S.E.C. of Citigroup's mortgage-backed securities offerings... but also avoids any investors' relying in any respect on the S.E.C. Consent Judgment in seeking return of their losses. If the allegations of the Complaint are true, this is a very good deal for Citigroup; and, even if they are untrue, it is a mild and modest cost of doing business.\" Read the full report from the Wall Street Journal&gt;\n",

Listen Jon, and I mean no disrespect ...\" \"That's always a loaded introduction to a comment,\" Hilsenrath responded. Santelli continued and asked Hilsenrath why reporters throw so many \"softball questions\" at these press conferences and why Hilsenrath thinks we need Quantitative Easing. \"You're jumping to a whole bunch of conclusions here...Let's start with QE.

We ask tough questions at the press conference and elsewhere...\" \"What was the question you asked last time?\" Santelli pressed. \"How long are you going to stick around? I think a lot of people wanted to know that,\" Hilsenrath said. \"I don't know. I don't think that's a tough question, Jon.\"  Santelli told Hilsenrath that the reason that his stories move the markets is because the world at large believes he's sourced. \"That's a reality.

There is no polite mention of the founder's impact on the brand, as would be customary. 2. Shares and profits were gaining. The company just announced last week that profits were up a whopping 23%.

Im very mindful of the fact that I would not have had this career if I hadnt gone to the University of Pennsylvania, and the fact that I knew about the University of Pennsylvania was kind of a fluke. She went on to earn her MBA from the University of Chicago, where she was one of merely ten female students in her class. In the early days of her career, she recalls, We knew [women] were a huge minority. We knew we were kind of pioneers, and it was kind of fun. Now, however, the role of women in finance is evolving. I think were looking for a point in time when senior management and boards of directors are coming to something thats approaching 40% [female].

      "REUTERS/Jonathan ErnstFederal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke takes the stage for a news conference at the Federal Reserve offices in Washington, March 20, 2013.After a big sell-off in the bond market following the last time Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke made a public appearance (at his testimony before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress on May 22), most expect today's FOMC monetary policy statement to strike a dovish tone and attempt to pare back some of the volatility that has appeared in financial markets. The big concern, of course, is that the Federal Reserve will begin tapering back the pace of bond purchases it makes under its quantitative easing program of monetary stimulus sooner than the market was pricing in  maybe even as soon as September. Socit Gnrale interest rate strategistsCiaran O'Hagan andVincent Chaigneau think the Fed has something very different in mind for today. In a note to clients, they write: We expect the Fed will choose to provide more helpful guidance on tapering and eventual exit steps. Our baseline scenario is that the Fed will begin tapering asset purchases in September. This guidance will likely come primarily during the press conference, though a slight nod to its initiation within a few meetings could appear in the FOMC statement. Volatility over the past few days  with substantial re-pricings on every recycled press article of Fed musings  seems to indicate that the market has not eased into a consensus ahead of the FOMC. If, as we expect, the Fed does provide additional guidance around tapering and does not remove the 'few meetings' construct established in Bernankes JEC testimony Q&amp;A  it could catch some market participants flat-footed. The bias for an FOMC response is towards a stronger sell-off  the stronger the guidance, the stronger the sell-off. That's markedly different from what most expect  perhaps some tweaking of the language in the FOMC statement and overtures from Bernanke during the presser to dissuade volatility. If O'Hagan and Chaigneau are right, markets may be in for a bit of a surprise today.\n",

As the paper shows, the income share of the top 1% in the U.S. declined from a high of around 24% just before the Great Depression to a low of about 9% in the late 1970s. Since then, it has soared all the way back to about 23% just before the Great Recession, but falling back to 20% in 2010. Other English-speaking countries have had similar \"U shaped\" patterns, as the authors describe them (i.e., reaching Great Depression levels again), but the share of the 1% is much less in other countries. For example, in Australia, even though the 1% share is close to what it was in the 1920s, it is still only 10% of total income, compared to 20% in the U.S. This difference is part of the reason thatmedian wealthis so much higher in Australia.The paper gives examples of other countries where the 1% share is permanently below its 1920s level, such as Germany, Japan, France, and Sweden. In all four cases, that share is only about 10%. As Johnston emphasizes, these countries are all essentially equal to the U.S. technologically (remember back in the 1980s when so many people thought Japan was poised to eclipse the U.S. in technology?), so their substantially lower levels of inequality stand in direct contradiction to frequent economists' claims that technology is the problem (Richard Freemanhas a balanced analysis).It is also important to point out, as Johnston does, that lower tax rates on the 1% have an impact on this. One suggestion the paper makes is that lower tax rates give CEOs and other top managers more incentive to bargain for higher income, so the effect even shows up in pre-tax income. Obviously, lower tax rates make post-tax income even more unequally distributed.\n",
      "Flickr/Medill DCLately, Fed reporters have become the most important financial journalists on the planet. When people like WSJ's Jon \"Fedwire\" Hilsenrath speak, traders listen and markets move. For the most part, they have earned this reputation by getting great scoops from Fed insiders or people very close to the Fed. But today, it'll be all about questioning. UBS's Art Cashin believes it's on the Fed reporters shoulders to ask the right questions to Chairman Ben Bernanke at today's post-FOMC press conference. From Cashin: The Bernanke Press Conference  This could be a very important economic event. Bernanke will have to be very careful and very adroit. He will, likely, take very great pains to differentiate between tapering and tightening. He probably will take pains to defend the whole QE process (by laying out areas of progress from the very dire straits we were in). A very, very great deal will depend on how adept the reporters in the room are. Will they be able to pull out degrees of tapering? Will it be in \"baby steps\" of reduction (5 billion or 10 billion)? Will it be in both Treasuries and mortgages? In equal amounts? What about the money that pours in from the existing portfolio (interest and maturity pay-down)? Will that money be poured back into the markets (supplemental QE)? Will they be forced to taper by diminished supply rather than monetary policy? Will they announce that to the public? Finally, can they pin him down on exactly what targets/guidelines that the FOMC is using to adjust policy? Just how hard are those targets? And that's just the antipasto. It could be great if all rise to the occasion.\n",

      "BloombergBob JanjuahEveryone's waiting for the Fed's big announcement and press conference this afternoon. And everyone is also guessing what the Fed might do next. The main thing no one can agree about is when the Fed will start tapering, or reducing, its bond-buying plan. And the best way to predict when the Fed will taper, one must understand why the Fed would taper. Nomura's bear Bob Janjuah believes the \"why\" is fear. From his note last week: So for me, tapering is going to happen. It will be gentle, it will be well telegraphed, and the key will be to avoid a major shock to the real economy. But the Fed is NOT going to taper because the economy is too strong or because we have sustained core (wage) inflation, or because we have full employment - none of these conditions will be seen for some years to come. Rather, I feel that the Fed is going to taper because it is getting very fearful that it is creating a number of significant and dangerous leverage driven speculative bubbles that could threaten the financial stability of the US. In central bank speak, the Fed has likely come to the point where it feels the costs now outweigh the benefits of more policy.\n",

Adjusted Q4 earnings unexpectedly jumped to $2.13 per share from $1.99 a year ago. Analysts were expecting the company to report adjusted earnings of $1.95 per share. Revenue, however, came in at $11.4 billion, which was right in line with expectations. FedEx Ground posted another strong year and FedEx Freight margins continued to improve, said CEO Fred Smith. These positive developments did not fully offset tepid economic growth and customer preference for less costly international shipping services.\" The company announced plans to reduce Express capacity in July between Asia and the U.S. Our profit improvement program is progressing, but we continue to see the effects of customers selecting lower-rate international services,\" said CFO Alan Graf. \"FedEx Express will further decrease capacity between Asia and the United States in July.

      "Justin Sullivan/Getty Images/AFPUS satellite television provider Dish Network said on Tuesday it has dropped plans to submit a revised bid for Sprint Nextel, paving the way for a rival offer from Japan's SoftBank. Dish said it still saw \"strategic value\" in a merger with Sprint but that it would not submit a revised offer by Tuesday's deadline owing to Sprint's decision to terminate due diligence and accept a SoftBank offer. \"We will consider our options with respect to Sprint, and focus our efforts and resources on completing the Clearwire tender offer,\" it added, referring to a separate deal. The move clears the way for SoftBank's merger bid with Sprint targeting a 78% chunk of the third-largest US mobile carrier. At $21.6 billion, the deal could mark the biggest overseas acquisition ever by a Japanese firm. SoftBank had upped its offer last week by about $1.6 billion from an initial $20 billion offer. \"We look forward to receipt of the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) and shareholder approvals which will allow us to close in early July and begin the hard work of building the new Sprint into a meaningful third competitor in the US market,\" said SoftBank spokesman Kurano Mitsuhiro, after Dish pulled out of the bidding. SoftBank's Tokyo-listed shares closed 4.20% higher at 5,460 yen ($57) on Wednesday. Last week, a joint SoftBank-Sprint statement encouraged Sprint investors to vote for the deal at a June 25 shareholders meeting. In April, SoftBank chief Masayoshi Son painted his deal as superior, saying the Japanese firm had more experience in debt-financed takeovers and his bid could be consummated one year earlier than its rival. The proposed takeover would see already heavily indebted SoftBank taking on even more debt. But it won a high-profile boost as New York-based hedge fund Paulson &amp; Co, Sprint's second-largest shareholder, said it would back the SoftBank offer as it praised the company's \"exceptional operating expertise\". Under the revised deal SoftBank would offer Sprint shareholders $16.6 billion in cash, compared with $12.1 billion previously, reducing the amount of cash the firm would receive. Last month US national security officials approved SoftBank's planned takeover, but said any merger must see the appointment of an independent member to the Sprint board of directors to serve as security director. The director, who must be approved by US authorities, would oversee national security matters and serve as a point of contact for US agencies. The US Department of Justice in January urged regulators to delay the proposed cross-border takeover until the national security ramifications had been evaluated. Dish, which offered $25.5 billion for Sprint, had said the tie-up with SoftBank would pose national security risks. Separately, Dish and Sprint are seeking control over heavily indebted US broadband firm Clearwire's large array of wireless services. Sprint wants Clearwire's spectrum and broadband WiMax network, which is becoming more valuable with the surge of mobile Internet use. Dish is seeking Clearwire's spectrum as part of an effort to build a company that could deliver a fully integrated nationwide bundle of video, television, broadband Internet and voice services. Last week, Clearwire urged its shareholders to accept Dish's takeover offer of $4.40 per share in cash, which would give Clearwire a market value of $3.1 billion. Sprint's last offer was for $3.40 a share. Copyright (2013) AFP. All rights reserved. \n",
      "REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes rance's President Nicolas Sarkozy (L) shakes hands with International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Christine Lagarde after a meeting at the Elysee Palace in Paris October 8, 2011. Christine Lagarde, one of the most powerful women in the world as managing director of the International Monetary Fund, is facing acute embarrassment after a letter in which she urged former French President Nicolas Sarkozy to \"use me\" was found during a police raid on her Paris flat. An undated copy of the letter was found at Mrs Lagardes flat in Paris during a raid by police investigating a spiralling financial scandal surrounding payments to businessman Bernard Tapie. \"I'm on your side to serve you and serve your projects for France,\" she said in the letter. \"Use me during the time that suits you best and fits your action and your cast....If you decide to use me, I need you as guide and supporter: without guide, I might be ineffective, without support I might be implausible.\" She signed off: With my immense admiration, Christine L. She also claimed that she does not have \"personal political ambitions\" and remarked she does not want to become \"an ambitious servant\", referring to some members of Sarkozy's entourage. Critics described the letter as a pledge of allegiance and is reported to have been written during the 2007 French Presidential campaign, when she held a relatively minor post. The letter was leaked to French newspaper Le Monde, and its publication has caused acute embarrassment for the head of the IMF. Ms Lagarde was finance minister during Mr Sarkozy's term as President, before stepping down to become managing director of the Washington-based IMF in 2011. Her Paris flat was raided as part of an investigation into her handling of a 2008 compensation payment to a businessman supporter of ex-president Nicolas Sarkozy, her lawyer said. Police are investigating claims that Lagarde, when French Finance Minister under Sarkozy, acted illegally in approving the 285m arbitration payout to Bernard Tapie. Ms Lagarde denies any wrongdoing. Mr Tapie, a controversial business figure, went to prison for match-fixing during his time as president of French football club Olympique Marseille. Prosecutors working for the Court of Justice of the Republic suspect the arbitration was payback for supporting Mr Sarkozy in the 2007 presidential election. The massive payout enabled Mr Tapie to clear his huge debts and tax liabilities, and reportedly left him with up to 40m. Ms Lagarde has insisted the arbitration was vital to close a costly dispute, and has always denied having acted under orders from Sarkozy \n",
      "Federal Reserve / USStreamIn its America's Morning Comment note, Nomura has a really nice way of summing up Bernanke's challenge today, as the Fed releases a new policy statement, economic forecast, commentary (at the press conference). But in the tepid market open, there was no doubt that attention was firmly focused on the Fed today, where the conclusion of the two-day FOMC meeting offers market participants a new policy statement, summary of economic projections and a press conference from Chairman Bernanke to dissect and digest. While our US economists do not expect the FOMC to announce a change in its asset purchases this month, they believe all three will signal that the Fed is moving closer to a decision to reduce the pace of purchases, while at the same time seeking to minimize the significance of the move so to calm recent market jitters. That's it. Establish some kind of path to ease up on the QE, while also making that seem like not a big deal. Good luck, Ben!

      "APSAO PAULO (AP)  Tens of thousands of Brazilians again flooded the streets of the country's biggest city to raise a collective cry against a longstanding lament  people are weighed down by high taxes and high prices but get low-quality public services and a system of government infected with corruption. That was the repeated message Tuesday night in Sao Paulo, where upward of 50,000 people massed in front of the city's main cathedral. While mostly peaceful, the demonstration followed the rhythm of protests that drew 240,000 people across Brazil the previous night, with small bands of radicals splitting off to fight with police and break into stores. Mass protests have been mushrooming across Brazil since demonstrations called last week by a group angry over the high cost of a woeful public transport system and a recent 10-cent hike in bus and subway fares in Sao Paulo, Rio and elsewhere. The local governments in at least four cities have now agreed to reverse those hikes, and city and federal politicians have shown signs that the Sao Paulo fare could also be rolled back. It's not clear that will calm the country, though, because the protests have released a seething litany of discontent from Brazilians over life's struggles. Yet, beyond complaints about the cost for bus and subway rides, protesters haven't produced a laundry list of concrete demands. Demonstrators mainly are expressing deep anger and discontentment  not just with the ruling government, but with the entire governing system. A common chant at the rallies has been \"No parties!\" \"What I hope comes from these protests is that the governing class comes to understand that we're the ones in charge, not them, and the politicians must learn to respect us,\" said Yasmine Gomes, a 22-year-old squeezed into the plaza in central Sao Paulo where Tuesday night's protest began. President Dilma Rousseff, a former leftist guerrilla who was imprisoned and tortured during Brazil's 1964-85 dictatorship, hailed the protests for raising questions and strengthening Brazil's democracy. \"Brazil today woke up stronger,\" she said in a statement. Yet Rousseff offered no actions that her government might take to address complaints, even though her administration is a prime target of demonstrators' frustrations. The protests have brought troubling questions about security in the country, which is playing host this week to soccer's Confederations Cup and will welcome Pope Francis in July for a visit to Rio de Janeiro and rural Sao Paulo. Brazil's media has scrambled to cover the sprawling protests  coverage that in some cases raised the ire of protesters, in particular that of the powerful Globo TV network. Whenever what appears to be a Globo helicopter swoops over a demonstration, protesters hiss, raise their fists and chant slogans against the network for what they say was its failure to widely show images of a violent police crackdown on protesters last week in Sao Paulo. Brazilian demonstrations in recent years generally had tended to attract small numbers of politicized participants, but the latest mobilizations have united huge crowds around a central complaint: The government provides woeful public services even as the economy is modernizing and growing. The Brazilian Tax Planning Institute think tank found that the country's tax burden in 2011 stood at 36 percent of gross domestic product, ranking it 12th among the 30 countries with the world's highest tax burdens. Yet public services such as schools are in sorry shape. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development found in a 2009 educational survey that literacy and math skills of Brazilian 15-year-olds ranked 53rd out of 65 countries, behind nations such as Bulgaria, Mexico, Turkey, Trinidad and Tobago, and Romania. Many protesting in Brazil's streets hail from the country's growing middle class, which government figures show has ballooned by some 40 million over the past decade amid a commodities-driven economic boom. They say they've lost patience with endemic problems such as government corruption and inefficiency. They're also slamming Brazil's government for spending billions of dollars to host next year's World Cup soccer tournament and the 2016 Olympics while leaving other needs unmet. A November report from the government raised to $13.3 billion the projected cost of stadiums, airport renovations and other projects for the World Cup. City, state and other local governments are spending more than $12 billion on projects for the Olympics in Rio. Nearly $500 million was spent to renovate Maracana stadium in Rio for the World Cup even though the venue already went through a significant face-lift before the 2007 Pan American Games. Attorney Agatha Rossi de Paula, who attended the latest protest in Sao Paulo along with her mother, called Brazil's fiscal priorities \"an embarrassment.\" \"We just want what we paid in taxes back, through health care, education and transportation,\" said the 34-year-old attorney. \"We want the police to protect us, to help the people on the streets who have ended up with no job and no money.\" Although a single group set the protests in motion with its demonstrations last week calling for lowered transit fares, the mass gatherings are showing no evidence of any central leadership, with people using social media to call for marches and rallies. Groups of Brazilians also staged small protests Tuesday in other countries, including Mexico, Portugal, Spain and Denmark. A cyber-attack knocked the government's official World Cup site offline Tuesday, and the Twitter feed for Brazil's Anonymous hackers group posted links to a host of other government websites whose content had been replaced by a screen calling on citizens to come out to the streets. Tuesday night's march in Sao Paulo started out peacefully but turned nasty outside City Hall when a small group lashed out at police and tried to invade the building. Different groups of protesters faced off, one chanting \"peace, peace\" while trying to form a human cordon to protect the building, the other trying to clamber up metal poles to get inside. At one point, one person tried to seize a metal barrier from another who was trying to use it to smash the building's windows and doors. The air was thick with police pepper spray and smoke after demonstrators set a TV satellite truck and a police lookout booth on fire. ___ Associated Press writers Jenny Barchfield in Rio de Janeiro, Marco Sibaja in Brasilia and Jill Langlois in Sao Paulo contributed to this report.

      "Flickr/garryknightLast week, the WSJ's ace Federal Reserve reporter Jon Hilsenrath wrote a piece on Fed strategy that got a lot of attention in markets. The gist was: Just because the Fed may signal a reduction in asset purchases doesn't mean that an interest rate hike is getting closer. Specifically Hilsenrath wrote: Federal Reserve officials have been trying to convince investors for weeks not to overreact when the central bank starts pulling back on its $85 billion-per-month bond-buying program. An adjustment in the program wont mean that it will end all at once, officials say, and even more importantly it wont mean that the Fed is anywhere near raising short-term interest rates. But in a note put out yesterday, Morgan Stanley Chief Economist Vincent Reinhart argues there's a flaw in this logic. Fed officials have been trying to convince everyone that their asset purchase decision  is data-dependent,  could be made soon, but,  once taken, does not put the balance sheet on a fixed course. The logical conclusion they hope everyone draws from this is that, as it is a flexible instrument subject to an ongoing calibration of the costs and benefits, the onset of tapering does not convey information about the date of the first fed funds rate hike.  Such an inference, however, is flawed. As long as the Fed is using the two instruments to influence the economy, policy decisions on their setting depend on the Feds outlook for the economy. A change in one reveals something about a change in the Feds outlook, which therefore has implications for the other policy instrument. Asset purchases can be a data-dependent, flexible instrument, but they will also be informative. Logically then, the Feds tapering talk reveals some combination of their being more confident about the economic outlook and less convinced that additional QE is providing net benefits. Basically, if both QE and rate decisions are data dependent, then you can't separate the two. Probably the best defense of the Fed on this is that for a rate hike, the parameters are incredibly clear. Evan's Rule sets the levels at which the Fed would consider raising rates, and it won't raise rates before then. On the other hand, the pace of QE is clearly more subjective (and possibly also takes into account a desire to prevent excess speculation). Anyway, between this confusion, and the latest comments from Obama hinting that Bernanke's time at the Fed is over, we should be in for one hell of a press conference today.\n",

      "Daniel Goodman / Business Insider.comIt's been an interesting couple of months in world markets. In a sense, we've seen a level of volatility and confusion that we haven't seen in awhile. This is especially apparent in any emerging markets (and of course Japan). And yet US equities have held up very well. And the rise in US interest rates is arguably a very bullish sign. In a note this morning, SocGen's Kit Juckes says the next leg of volatility is on its way. He suggests that in addition to rate volatility, that you should keep an eye on credit spreads, and that buying opportunities are likely to present themselves at some point in the future. The next leg of a summer of market volatility is likely to start in the days ahead. EM currencies are in the firing line first - BRL, INR and RUB all stand out. The next leg of the rise in US bond yields will probably take 10yr Note yields towards 2.5% this summer, and 2y/2y rates towards 2%. I'd pencil in CDX in the US at 100 from 82 currently and the iTraxx crossover at 500 in the fist instance, though the sell-off is a chance to buy credit after the summer.

      "REUTERS/Kevin LamarqueThe whole world has been anxiously waiting for this moment. The Federal Reserve will wrap up its 2-day Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting today. At 2:00 PM ET, it will publish its FOMC statement as well as an update to its economic forecasts. Then at 2:30 PM ET, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke will hold a press conference, which will include a Q&amp;A with economics reporters. Expectations Economists expect the Fed to announce no change in its benchmark interest rate target, which is currently at 0% to 0.25%. Furthermore, they expect no change in its quantitative easing (QE) program, which consists of the Fed buying $85 billion worth of bonds each month to keep interest rates low. However, there is little agreement on when the Fed will begin to scale back its easy monetary policy. Recently, there has been tons of speculation that the Fed will soon taper, or gradually reduce, QE. This has been the source of volatility in the global financial markets as real interest rates have finally started to make a big up-move. \"There is no direct way to quantify what the market is pricing in for the size of the Feds remaining asset purchases,\" said Bank of America Merrill Lynch's David Woo. But he added that \"QE tends to push real yields lower but inflation breakevens higher (Chart 7).\" BAML, David Woo As such, everyone will listen very carefully for changes in language that may signal if and when tapering will begin. In particular, the updated economic forecasts will scrutinized very carefully. Here's the WSJ's Jon Hilsenrath: The evolution of these forecasts is a critical issue. Fed officials are unlikely at this meeting to change their $85-billion-per-month bond-buying programlaunched to boost growth by pushing down long-term interest rates and pushing up asset prices, and spurring spending, hiring and investment. But what they say about the economy will send important signals about what they expect to do in the future. If they maintain confidence in their economic forecasts, it could signal they think they're on track to begin pulling back the program later this year. Here's what Wall Street's top economists expect from the Fed tomorrow (emphasis added):\n",
